- vaR the first time in many months a relative calm reigns
..... *-in the headquarters of Unesco in Paris, for many
members of our Secretafiat have departed in order to at-
tend the : econd Session of the General Conférence in
Mexico during this month. In September and October,
Unesco House was a veritable beëhive of activity as pre-
parations were made for the month-Iong conférence. In-
deed, though thé spotlight of attention now shifts to Mexico
City, it was Paris during the preceding months WhlCh
constituted, for Unesco, the hub from which radiated the
plans, projects, drafts and programmes which will con-
stitute the basis of the many conferences of the second
Session in Mexico. For the General Conference, the Diree-
tor-General prepared a spécial report on Unesco's first year
ol existence. Excerpts from this document will be found
elsewhere on page 1. It should be noted, in passing, that
the complete text of Dr. Huxley's report, which has been
ttistributed to the governments of Member States, is now
on sale to thé gênerai publie in English. French and Span-
ish éditions.
Pursuing its activities in the main Unesco-wide projects,
the Organisation sponsored. on October 18, the first meet-
ing of a co-ordinating committee designed to serve as lia-
soi between Unesco and the international voluntary organ-
isations concerned with educational reconstruction, Thé
United Nations'International Children's Emergency Fund
has now set up office in Unesco House. At a conference
of international non-govemmental organisations, it was
recommended that a portion of the Childcen's Fund Budget
should be set aside for Unesco's work in educational re-
construction.
Free Flow of Information
Great importance was attached to the series of meet-
ings held : n Unesco House during O : : tober on the free
flow of information. Experts from Europe, Asia and the
United States heard Dr. Walter Ii C. Laves, who had re-
cently tetumed from a goodwill tour of the USA and
Canada, declare tha, t the work of the Committee then
meeting would be complementary to the work of the United
Nations Conference on the Freedom of Information,
scheduied to take place in Geneva next March. It would
be the task of the United Nations, said Dr. Laves, to study
political and bureaucratic obstacles to the free flou ouf
knowledge, while the present Committee of Unesco would
concern itseif with what could be dore to improve thé
flow of news of educat1onal, scientific or cultural import-
ancre within the limitation imposed by existing obstacles.
One of the highlights of the meetings was the proposai to
create national centres for the dissemination of such in-
formation. The Committee reached unantmous agreement
on the concept of the free flow of information, the text
of the resolution adopted reading. in part, as follows :"Thé
Information which can lead men to undcrstanding. the
understanding which oan lead men to peace, dépend on a
ffee flow of word and image across national borders...
But open avenues alone do not suffice. Freedom her°. as
elsewhere. must be harnessed to responsibility, which means
the effort to statue the t, ruth."Re3ponsible information

of the separate branches and activities of thé orgniza*
tion. The third looks toward the future.
"What l want to put m the forefcont,"writes Dr. Houx.
ley,"is the gratifying and indeed suiiprising extent of
Unesco's achievements in the brief space of thé few monts
of its independent existence."
The report then reviews ttie progress of Unesco in the
fields of science, education and culture. These activities
range from the urgent programme of educational recon-
struction in war-ravaged countries, to fundamental éduca-
tion for backward people and the development of inter-
national understanding through education. Associated with
the latter is a project of findioa iW'ays La ceduce interna-
tional tensions affecting peace.
How these and man y other projects have been developed
and carried out during"this critical first year of Unesco's
existence"is explained in detail in the report, as is theit
relation to the central task of Unesco to contribue to
peace and secucity through the fields of éducation, science
and culture.
The report of the Director-General aiso includes an ex-
planation of Unesco's relationship to the United Nations
and its specialized agencies, and Unesco's means of co-
ordinating its objectives through Kovernment and inter-
national groupa.
Thé reader will find below significant excerpts from the
full text, which has now been published in booklet form.
The full text is being distributed to the governments of
Unesco's 
Member Statues and has now been placed on sale
 to the public at 60 francs, 50 cents. : !.'Gj, or 2. 50 Mexioan

GENERAL SURVEY OF UNESCO S FIRST YEAR
In subm ! tt ! ng th1s, the Directl') r General's first Annual
Report to the General Conference of Unesco. l shall not
begin by an ordered enumeration of OUI'programme 8-CtlÌv-
ities since the end of the First Session of the Générât
Conférence in Paris, nor by a description of the graduai
developments of its organization during 1947. though these
with rightly occupy the bulk of my report. What l want
to put in the foreront is the gratifying and indeed sur-
prising extent of Unesco's achievement in the brief space
of the few montait of its independent existence. Only by
bearing this in mind will it be possible te appreciate the
det. ailed picture of the programme and the organizatiaual
structure.
In dealing with Unesco's programme activities, 1 shall
adopt the following order. First, the comprehensive pro-
jects involving all of most of Unesco's subject-fields ; sec-
ondly, the centralized units servicing the programme ; and
tthirdiy, the activities of the sect10ns dealing with the
various distinct and separate fieids with which Unesco is
concerned. In this last category, l shall begin with the
substantive subject fields of Education, Science and Culture
in the following order-Education, Naturel Science. Social
Science. Philosophy and Humanities, Arts and Letters ; and
shall end with thé agencies or appa, ra. tus for promoting
éducation and for storing and disseminating science and
culture, in the shape of Libraries. Muséums, and the Medtilo
of Mass Communication-Press. Film and Radio.
Aid to Stricken Arcas
The first of our comprehensive"Unesco-wide"projects is
Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, the vitally urgent but
Slhort-tcrm task which is, in the war-devastated countries,
the pré-condition of ail other Unesco activities.
Books for libraries, materials of all kinds for schools,
scientific workshops for laboratories, instruments for
musicians. fellowships and t. raining scholarshLps for men
and women, are being provided, to a small entent froc
Unesco's own funds but mainly out of the more tha. n 72
million dollars'worth of money and materials already col-
tcctcd or promiscd through thé efforts of the voluntary
organisations. Further, Unesco is àorawing the attention
of agencies conecrncd with proMc'ns of economic réhabilita-
tion. to thé important implications of educational, sciemific
and cutturn ! reconstruction in their task.
The FU1ldamc1ltal Education projcct has made much
progressin dcfining the aims and scope of fundamental
cducation. Unesco has participatcd with the Chinese
Governmcnt in organizing a Régional Conférence on the
subject in China, and is organixing another in Mexico
at 1 le time of the General Confercnce. The volume pre-
parcd last yenr,"Fundamental Education : Common
Ground for All pcoplrs,"hs bccn succcssfutly published
in English and Ffcnch. and éditions in Spanish, Portu-
guesc and Arabie are in prepat ition. Detailed schemes
for lJhree pilot projects, in Haiti. China and British East
Africa. have been worked out. Il the last-named region,
prcliminary work will begin imnicdiatcly in one afea in
Nyasaland. In addition, a preliminary agreement has
becs reachcd whercby Unesco will later advise on the
cdHcational aspects of the unique Groundnuts Scheme in
Tanganyika tcrritory, in which large numbecs of. nom4
Jilerule tribal Africans will bc resetticd and trained in
modern techniques of agriculture and of living. The
convocation of a group of experts to study thé methods
of language tcaching and of thé use of auxiliafy lan-
guages involved in an international attack on illiterac7
have led to more adequate plans for dealing with the
many linguist ! c : problems invCJIIWd ln Unesco'8 p&'CÞo

A detailed and fully documented report on the progress
made by Unesco in all branches of activity during its
first year of existence was prepared in August by Dr.
Julian Huxley, Director-GeneraJ, in a 95-page document
which wu be officially submitted to the second Session
of Unesco's General Conference at Mexico City.
The Directoc-General's report is divided into tjhree parts.
The first gives a succinct account of Unesco's development
and performance during 1947 and is designed foc purposes

The many-sided project for Edu-
cation in International Under-
standing has begun to take shape.
The first seminar on the subject
bas been held in Paris, attended
by 79 experts, administratora and
teachers from 31 different coun-
tries. Text-books are arriving from
ail parts of the world, and their
anatysis is beginning with a view
to promoting better understanding
of international problems, of re-
moving sources of international
friction, and of establishing friend-
ly images of other nations. We
have begun a study of how inter-
national understanding is taught
in the schools of our Member Na-
tions. Finally, we have given much
thought to plans for extending this
project in 1948.

The project on Tensions Abject-
<K/n<ernot ! o ? ! a ! U ? t< ! ers<att< !t ? tjng International Understanding
(formerly known as"Tensions
Crucial to Peace") has been more
closely linked with that for Inter-
national Understanding. and ex-
pert aid has been enlited Whléh
has defined its scope much more
clearly and fully.
For its fourth comprehensive
project, the Institute 01 the Hylean
Amazon, Unesco has had the ben-
efit of the full collaboration of
the Brazilian Government. After
a preliminary survey on the spot,
a Commission met in August
and recommended the setting up
of the International Hylean Ama-
zon Institute for research and sur-
vey in the area.
In the Spring of 19-i7. a detail-
ed plan for co-ordination of
Unesco's work with Fellowships
and Scholarships was d ;'a\vn up.
and following on this. a central
service for the Exchange of Per-
sons has now been set up in
Unesco House. A 
second central
service for Documentation, includ-
ing Unesco's on library and a
statistical branch, has also been
set up, and is bcginning',') operate
in many of the varied fields which
it must cover. Its work is the
pré-condition for thc"D : rectory

Unesco as a whole are Transla-

nomic and Social Council referred
to Unesco the problems of transia-
tion of the classics. with a view
to betlçr understanding bel ween
cultures, and to providing a foun-
dation for a world culture. We
have set up a co : nmittcc on Trans-
lations, which has Konc somc Iray
in charting ; our future cour. sc of
operations in this large and dif-
ficult field, and also in thé neigh-
bouring onc of translation of con-
temporary works. We have also
appointed a consultant on Copy-
right who. with the a-ssistance of
a Committee of Expcrts, is pre-
p3ring g-j-danec for our later par-
ticipation in a wor) d conferfnce

the Middie East, and the Far

chinery to service them. After
the signinl1 of a formai agreement
with the International Council of
Scientific Unions (ICSU), Unesco
has made numerous grants
through this body, as a result of
which special conferences have
been held, younger scientistes have
been able to travel to international
meetings, international scientific
laboratories have been helped to
recover their footing, and inter-
national stock-rooms and collec-
tions have been established.
An important report has been
furnished to the Economic and
Social Couneil on the possibility
of establishing United Nations La-
boratories in certain subjects,
close collaboration has been ar-
ranged with Unesco's sister agen-
i cies coneerned with aspects of ap-
i plied science, the FAO and the
WHO, and steps have been taken
to stimulate the formation of non-
governmental international organ-
izations in those scientific fields
where they were iacking. such as
the History and Philosophy of
Science, Theoretical and Applied
Mechanics and the Engineering
Sciences. Large numbers of ques-
tions and requests from individuals
and scientific organizations have
been met. Co-ordination of ab-
stracting services has been begun.
A questionnaire has been sent out
zon Unesco's possible rôle in the
asocial implications of science and
its popuiarization. the anstwers to
which will be examined with a
view to recommending a project in

It has concentrated on thc
eventual setting up of a would-
wide library network, including na-
tional centres for book exchange
and distribution. It has drawn up
a Book Coupon scheme, aimed
at overcoming some of the cur-
rency and exchange barriers that
now prevent the passage of books
across national frontiers. Much
thought has been given to projects
for improving the world's service
of public and popuhr libraries, to
various bibliographical and. tech-
nical aspects of library twork, and 1
to the proper training of libra-
rians.
In the field of Museums, impor-
tant contacts have been made, and
in particular a formai agreement
is under discussion. vith the newly
formed International Council of
Museums (ICOM) ; plans have
been drawn up for our participa-
tion in the first regional confer-
ence of ICOM, to be held during
the second session of our Gérera !
Conference in Mexico, and in its
first full Conference planned for
next Summcr in Paris. A spic ; ail
survey was made of the needs of
museums, notably science mu-
sérums, 
in war-devastated European
'countries.
Film, Prcss and Radio
Tht highlight of activities during
1947 in the Media of Mass Conta-
munications has b !'en the Commis-
sion on Technical Needs. which
considered thé 
technical needs in
press, film and radio of twelve
war-devastated countries, 10 in Eu-
rope and 2 in Asia, on the basis
of field surveys and enquiries by
questionnaire and correspondence.
Much attention is paid to thé
question of the technical training
'of workers.
Unesco has alto secured the
establishment of a considérable
number of feliowships to give pro-
fessional workers in the mass
media from war-devastated coun-
tries a training in the most mo-
dern methods and techniques.
Unesco has participated actively
in the work of the UN Sub-Com-
mission on Freedom of Informa-
tion and of the Press ; and also'
in that of the UN Fi) m Board. ! hc

it is inévitable that Unesco should

Given our mandate, and the
size of our staff, our budget can

indeed, many activities approved by

partial or total suspense for lack

Générât hranuwork
One working approach that early
emerged was that Unesco must en-
deavour to raise thé gênerai stand-
ard of education, science and cul-
ture throughout tihe world, but with
special référence to less privileged
ares and sections.
This approach is implicit in the
project of Reconstruction and Re-
habilitation. in the establishment of
Field Science Co-opefation offices.
in our major project of Funda-
mental Education in the projects
for improving adult education ; in
those for developing and extending
public and popular libraries ; in the
sut'veys of the role of the arts in
gênerai education and in the com-
munit y at large and in many other
Unesco projet.,.
A second working principle ot
great importance is concerned with
Unesco's altitude to the cultural
dive :'sity of the wor ! d. On the one
hand we must not merely recognize
th : s cultural diwrsity as a fact. but
welcome it as making for a greater

A one-day conférence, held at

thé Unesco project towards setting
up a possible"Wo. r]d University of

Thé conference met as part of
the Organisation's effort, to stim-
ulate the production and wider dis-
tribution, by national organisations,
of radio brqadcasts designed ta
promote hutnan weifafe and inter-
national understanding.
Thé Directors-General 
of the
Swiss, Beigian. French and Luxem-
bourg radio networks were invited
by Unesco to discuss a plan where-
by each would be responsible for
thé production of a series of six
1 French-language broadcasts to be
i interchallged, free of charge, among
them. Thé proposai met wiGh
unanimous support and it was sug-
gested that if the broadcasts
proved successful af rangements
shouM be made for them to be
translated into other languages.
Each programme wil : consist of
a 
round-table discussion by experts
speciaiising in a particular sub-
'ject and. will last for about 15
minutes. Experts of any national-
ity may be invited on condition
that they speak French. The na-
tional systems will be responsible
for the technical aspects of the
broadcasts and the tcxts and invi-
tations wi1J be submitted to Unesco
before the discussions take place.
It is expected that the first pro-
gramme will be broadcast in Jan-
uary. 1948. and the other wiJ ! fol-
low at fortnightiy intervais ; the
complete series is expected to ex-
tend over a period of about a year.

Co-ordination of Medical

philosophy and Humanities
Examined in W orld Crisis
THE Committee of Experts on Philosophy and Humanistic Studies,
which met from Spptcmber 22 to 26 at Unesco House in Paris,
recommended two projects to Unesco. These orojects are designed to
WPlY the resources of philosophy and the humanities to the present
moral 1 and inteUectuaI cfisis of thé world. Thc first requires an investi-
gation into the philosophic concepts involved in the present conf1ict
of ideologies ; a project based on a suggestion made by the Committee
on the Philosophic Bases of Human Rights. The. sc atudies inctude

Unesco's relations with the
United Nations and its specialiseù
agencies, and with other interna-
tional and non-governmental organ-
isations will be studied, and re-
ports from member states discussed.
The last days of the conference
will be devoted in part to considef-
ing the reports and recommenda-
tions of the specialised commis-
sions and working parties, and the
setting of a date and place for the
third General Conference. Alto-
gether, 18 Plenary and 37 Technical
Sessions have been planned in a
six-day working week. The Confer-
ence will adjourn during the period !
November 21-23, for the Mexican'
national holidays.
It was decided at the 1946 Gen-
eral Conference that the annual
"Unesco Month"should also be
held in Mexico City to coincide
with the Conference, thus foc. ussing
the spotlight of public attention on
Unesco's activities. The Mexican
govefnment have arranged song
festivals, exhibitions of Mexican
and pre-Columbian art, programmes
of modern Mexican music and old
Mexican folk-dances. From mem-
ber states have come exhibits of
library and museum items. There
wiU also be a display of Unesco's
work in the field of fundamental
eduoation. The possibility of send-
ing these two lattef exhibitions on
tour will be considered.
This gathering of intellectuah
from all parts of the world has
necessitated much administrative
planning, and the greatest possible
co-operation has been received from
the Mexican govefnment.
President Aleman has authorised
the issue of a special stamp for the
Conference, and on the eve of open-
ing, the Mexican Ministry of Educa-
tion had set up a National Com-
mission for co-operation with
Unesco.
Thé City's hotels are already jam-
'packed, and among those which will
house the delegates is the Hotel
Prada, being completed in time for
the conference. The 61-year-old
Mexican artist, Diego Rivera, was
commissioned to paint a scene of
Mexico City's fashionable Alamcda
Park on the halls of the huge din-
ing room. Into this background,
Rivera has introduced 148 figures,
representing characters from Mex-
ico's history.

In order Lao avoid duplication, 1t
was recommended that Excerpta

should be asked 1. 0 consider reduc-
ing the range of subjects covered
by their services. Biological
Abstracts and British Abstracts on
the one hand, and Excepta Medica
and World Abstfacts on t. he other
hand, should be asked to study the
possibility of exchanges of abstracts.
The Conference also recom-
Ulenùed that Unesco set up an
"Interim Co-ordinating Committee"
composed of non-profit-tnaking ab-
stracting services in the medical
field whose work is international
in scope. It was proposed that the
Committee's first meeting should be
held in the Spring of 1948.
IT has long been felt that an
urgent need existed for provid-
ing, on a co-operative basis, scien-
tific médical information by means
of abstfacting current publica-
tions. During October, a confer-
ence was convened in Paris by
Unesco, of representatives of ab-
stracting services in the medical
and related sciences.
Unesco's ultimate aim, in this
field, is to co-ordinate services 80
that medical and biological scien-
tists can be pfovided with short
résumés of every scientific paper
appearing in their field of interest
anywhere in thé world. At the
October Conference the représen-
tatives agreed on the desirability
of establishing such services on a
non-profit-making basis.
shouici be encouraged to carry out
research programmes.
Emphasis was placed on the
importance of Unesco's pfogramme
for the translation of the c1assics
and two new international collec-
tions were proposed : one of pictor-
ial documents showing the develop-
ment of cultural phenomena and
ideas, and the other a library of
records and sound tracks.
The1aleeting, was held under the
chairmanship of Senor Sa. lvador de
Madariaga. Dr. D. W. Brogan
(Ca. mbfidge) was chairman of the
sub-committee on Humanistic Stud-
ies, and Prof. Aake Petzall (Lund)
was ehairman of the sub-commit-
tee on Philosophy. The General
Rapporteur was Prof. McKeon
(Chicago).
democracy, justice and equality.
The experts rxommended that. in 
addition to philosophers in the
toohnical sense, humanists, social 
scientists and natural scientists
6should be consultez. :
It was suggested to Unesco that 1
a scholar be associated with the 1
Organisation for a certain period 1
of time to prepare a basic state-1
ment of these problems which 1
6should include illustrative. material
drawn from the various cultures
and literature and should touch on j
the sevefai ages of history.
This statement, in the form of a i
questionnaire,, would then be sent
to national commissions, organisa-
tions and individuals representative
of the various social and inteHec-
tuai catégories.
Cultural Antagol1isms 1
The Committee suggested that
the results of this conference
should be utilised for dca. wing up
programmes of education, pro-
grammes for the media of mass
communications, or programmez
for the improvement of interna- !
tional undefstanding.
The second project recommended
to Unesco for immédiate attention
concems the study of the various
conflicts which are in the course
of developing between cultures.
The fact that the subjective
estimate of one's own culture and
that of other peoples's is often in-
exact and distorted is a crucial
élément in most conflicts in which
cultural antagonisms pass from in-
direct ways of expression to open
violence. Thé C0411mittee therefore
suggested that a questionnaire be
sent to varions nations inquiring
into the conceptions thcy hold of
their own cultures, which would,
then form the basic document for
a conference to be called to discuss
the relations between the varions !
cultures of the would,

In view of the iimited resources
of the Organisation, thc experts
proposed a number of ways in
which such exchangfs con ; d be ac-
compiishcd.
Chief among such suggestions
livras the recommendation that
Unesco assign funds for g. rants-in-
aid for philosophy and the human-
ities on a scale similar to th06e
which have been made avai) ab) e
for the natural sciences.
A further proposai was that
Unesco shou ! d aoproach thé vari-
ous international organisations of
humanistic studies with thé sug-
gestion that they font an interna-
tional eouncil comparable to thé
International Councii of Scientific
Unions.
It. was a ;.' ; o recommrndcd that

tions and con. su ; t with those al-

Co-ordination vitrai
These last two guiding principles
bring me immediately to a con-
sidération of the origan : ational
framework necessary for Uncsco's
successful operation.
The principle of unity at once
implies that there must be the c ! os-
es co-operation between the dit-
ferent subject fields within thé
organization's competence. Unesco
must at ail costs avoid operatingonlY,
through a series of separate depart-
mentis (such as are found in many
universities), devoted to pedagogy,
natural science, social science, the
humanités, the radio, film and
oress, the line arts, and so forth-'
departments which might aH too
easily become competitive and grow
tnto watertight comparlments 1sol-
uting différent aspects of the
higher activities of man.
At the beginning of the ycar a
study was made of the poss : bijty of
abolishing the different s ; Jbcct
sections altogether and of sub-
stituting a series of projects and
KCtivities, aU of which wOllld de-
mand the co-operation of spccialists
from many fields.
This proved to be imp-acticaMe :
it is. and will continue to be, neces-
sary to have within the Secretariat
groups of specialists in each field
of Unesco's compétence-groups
which for the moment we may con-
tinue to cala Sections.'
However, important steps have
been taken in thé other direction.
Firstly, if was decided to take a
certain number of many-sided pro-
jects out of the sectional frame-
work and give them administrative
autonomy. So far. as al4'cady
mentioned. four such comprehen-
sive projects have been set up-
for Reconstruction, for Funda-
mental Education, for Education
for International Understandmg.
and for the establishment of a
HyJcan Amazon Institue.'
( : enlral Service"
A second. step has been the estab.
iishment within the Secrétariat of
a number of what we may pro-
visionany caH Centra ! Services for
the carrying out of servies com-
mon to hall Sections. As noted. two
such sv : ces have already been set
: Ine for documentation and in-
formation, and one for fellowShips
and the exchange of persons.
Another step which promotes uni-
fied opération has been the estab-
lishmcnt of a Bureau of the Budget
and Administrative Planning, This,
is charged inter alia with prepar-
: ng a detailed budget for ale oui
opérations for the coming year.
The reviewing of the budget as a
whole gives much needed opportun-
ities for providing an équitable
balance betwcen Unesco' varioua
activities.
The settlng up of an effIcient
Burgau of Personne has a ! so
made for better balance between
Sections and greater uniformity
in methods of operation.
A Bureau of the ComptroUef ha<
a ! M been set up. This, with the
xbove-mentioned Bureaus of the
Budget and of Personnel, constlr
(Contlnued on Pape 4)
, 
(Continued Irom Page 2)
unified life for the peaceful world'
of the future.
A further implication to guide
us is that there must be a reason-
able balance between all the dif-
ferent subjects within our field
of competence. There must be no
over-weighing of any one subject
in Unesco's programme-of social
science as against the arts. for
instance, or of mass media against
more academic activities. Any lack
of balance which is actually visible
is due either to the fact that some
subjects are more ripe than others
for international treatment by an
agency like Unesco-''he Natural
Sciences, for example, somewhat
more so than the Social Sciences.
and much more so than the
Humanities ; or that in some
fields, like Reconstruction or
Media of Mass Communications,
the urgent tasks are very large.
Further, there must be no over-
weighting of particular aspects of
any one subject-of pure as
against applied science, or formai
as against adult education, or the
visual arts as against music-but
a reaspnable spread across thé en-
tire tield. eo-ordinated into a
single unified programme.
Cultural Bonds
Our final working principle is a
uasic one. implicit in our tune and
our Constitution. It is that of the
unity of human thought and crea-
tion, the inter-connection of all
thé higher activities of man. They
form a whole which is indivisible,
or at least one which suffers from
being divided. To further its
aims Unesco is thus obliged to
take account not oniy of ail as-
pects of science and all aspects
of culture, and also of all means
of preserving and transmitting
thèse, whether through éducation.
through the apparatus of books
and libraries, museums and art
galeries or through the modern
techniques of mass communica-
tion. but aiso of their inter-rela-
tions.
In working out our project for
the 1948 programme on the social
implications of science, the natural
"cient ists first made contact with
the social scientists, modifying the
scope of the project so as to em-
phasise the popular understand-
ing of the social and internationai
relations and implications of
science ; then with the experts in
Mass Media, Museums and Libra-
nes. who have a great 1"esponsibility
) n thé actua) business of present-
ing science and : ts social implica-
tions to the public ; and, finally, with
a) t thc other ect : ons and major
projects of Unesco, so as to bring
out the cducaUona ! and philoso-
phieat implications. Thc result was
both a broadening and a dccpening
of thc projet.

Achievement of Unesco

tutes the trio of offices required
for efficient day-to-day and year-
by-year administration.
Immediately after the first Ses-
sion of the General Conference, Dr
Walter Laves was appointed Deputy
Director-General, and somewhat
tater Professer Jean Thomas, one
of the two Executive Secretaries of
the Preparatory Commission, was
appointed Assistant Director-Gen-
errai.
During 1947 it has been neces-
sary to compromise between the
need for good geographical distribu-
tion and that for making the widest
canvass to secure the best possible
candidates, and the urgent noces.
sity of carrying out the programme.
As a result, the geographical dis-
tribution of members of the staff
Ils still very unsatisfactory. Fur-
thermore, almost ail appointments
have so far been short-term, for not
more than 12 months, and this has
involved a serious financial burden.
From now on, an increasing num-
ber of longer-term eontracts will be
given, and every attempt is being
made to remedy the faulty geogra-
phical distribution, though it must
be remembered that many coun-
tries are at the present time short
of highly qualified personnel, and
unable to spare them for work with
an international organization.
1 now turn to the Exécutive
Board, the other main organ nf
Unesco designed to assure con-
tinuity of working between the ses-
sions of the General Conférence.
The three meetings of the Board
held (up to the time of writing this
report) since the first Session of
the General Conference have been
invaluable to the Secretariat'
1 liant here to make special
mention of the United Nations
and of Unesco's óiser Speciahzed
Agenciez.
Unesco md L" : dl Nations
With the UN we have for many
months had a master relationship
agreement negotiated by us with
the Economic and Social Council
and duly ratified by the General
Assembly last December : and this
has more recently been supple-
mented by a subsidiary agreement
on information services. Our work-
ing relations have been close and
cordial with the departments of
Economic Affairs, of Social Af-
fairs, of Trustceship and of Pub-
lic Information, as well as with the
technical, financial and personnel
services of UN. more important
still pcrhaps was thé création,
under the terms of an Economic
and Social Council Resolution also
supported by the General Assem-
bly, of a Co-ordi11ating Commit tee
composed of Mr. Trygve Lie, the
Becretary-GencraI of UN, and the
Directors-General of the Special-
ized Agcncies. This committee is the
visible récognition of the prinsiple
that therc are many matters or

Prospects for 1948
In conclusion, l would like to
direct attention away from the
past and towards the future. The
exigencies of date require that
this report be written during the
month of August, so that more
than two months still remain be-
fore the beginning of the General
Conference. Further, one of the
most important activities of the
Organization on which it is my
duty hère to report consists in the
preparation of the Conférence it-
self, and of the programme and
the budget proposed for 1948.
As to the 1948 Programme, it
has been obvious from the start
that for the most part it must be
merely the continuation or the
extension of that for 1947, ai*
though in some cases the exten-
sions are qualitative rather than
quantitative, and so are half-way
to novelty. However, there are a
few entirely new projects through
which the range of Unesco's acti.
vities is being extended.
As examples of qualitative ex-
tensions of our present pro-
gramme, l may mention the set-
ting up of a special unit, or cor.
mittee, to deal with the broad
problems of linguistics, notably as
related to education. This is a
new extension of the work we
have aiready had to do in the
Fundamental Education Project
on language teaching and on the
problem of auxiliary ianguages.
Filling the Gaps
The most interesting projects
for. 1948, however, are those which
are''Quite new, and intended ta
filai some of the gaps in our pro-
gramme ; for the range of our ac-
tivities, as previously indicated,
ought to be as comprehensive as
possible in order to secure the
support of the various"interest
groups"concerned. Sometimes the
gap is a comparatively small one.
For instance, the promotion of
films dealing in a pope ! ar way
with the arts is quite new. but
the gap this pro. ject will fil in our
programme is not large. Again,
we are proposing to move on in
1948 from the problem of improv-
ing scicntific abstrait services to
the new problem of rationaliZ1Rg
the methods of scientific publica-
tion in general. Here the gap is
not large, but the probtem of
filling it is fuel of tcchnicai diffi-
culties.
A somewhat larger Rap should
hl'filled by the new oroject on
the needs and methods of univer-
sity deveiopment. which is not
only of obvious importance for
Unesco's work, but will appeal to
the infiuential interest group con-
sisting of university lcachers, re.
spareh workcrs and administra-
tors. Of similar scope is the pro-
ject for stimuiating thc miss-pro-
duction of cheap books on sub-
jects with which Unesco is con-
ccnH'd, ! Incl that for incrca. sin

with a view to the eventual con-
clusion of formai agreements.
Not the least important part or
Unesco's work 1s the establishment
of close contacts with private non-
governmental organizations. Some
of these relations are of a formaI
or officiai nature. This is the
case for certain organizations,
such as the World Federation
of United Nations Associations,
the International Council of
Scientific Unions, the Interna-
tional Studies Conference and the
International Council of Museums.
With several such bodies Unesco
had concluded, or was about to
conclude, agreements designed to
define the means of collaboration
and mutual assistance. The Exe-
cutive Board considered at its
Third Session, in July, that there
was some danger in piecemeal
handiing of this procedure, IWhich
in many cases involves the grant
of financial aid. Accordingly a
Committee of the Board reviewed
the whole position in September.
It recommended that Unesco
should in future establish working
consultative arrangements rather
than formai agreements with or-
ganizations approved by the
Executive Board, and that grants-
In-aid to. or contracts for the per-
formance of specified tasks by
organizations, should be consider-
ed on their own merits (the former
subject to the approval of the
Board) apart from the question of
co-operative arrangements or
agreements.
Unesco and Metnbcr States
With the Governments of our
own Member States our contacts
have naturally been close and
many-sided ; indeed, one uf our cur-
rent problems is to introduce order
and economy in the stream of com-
munications-mostly requests for
contributory action on items in
our programme-which we address
to them. An increasing number of
these Governments have appointed
special representatives in Paris to
deal, wholly or part-time, with
Unesco affairs, and at their re-
quest we have provided accommo-
dation for, up ta thé présent, six
of these in Unesco House. In ad-
dition, contacts have heen well
maintained with the Paris Embas-
sies of Member Nations and with
the office which thé Vatican has
set up here for liaison with Unesco.
Our contacts with the French
Government, as host of Unesco, are
naturaiiy very extensive, and have
been most friendly throughout.
Very special attention has been
given to promoting the creation
of National Commissions or Co-
operating Bodies in the Member
States, and to establishing close
relations lWith these where they
exist. Such bodies now exist in
some twelve Member States, and
other are in the process of for-
mation. The Secretariat has given
every assistance within its mcans
to thèse bodies, and has also re-
centiy instituted a scheme whereby
the Secretaries or other responsible
officiais of these bodies spend a
few weeks at Unesco House to
familiarize themseives with the Or-
'ganization.
National Commisl ! ion"
Every Member Government has.
'of course. fu) t liberty to set up
its National Commission in the
:  way which it considcrs most suit-
aile. In some countries the Com-
1 missions s (iU appear to be con-
'sidered as mcrrty advisory to thé

dividual enquirers on inr. umer-
able subjects, with well-wishers
and with occasional critics, there
is a constant stream of individual
visitors to Unesco House. To give
an idea of its magnitude, l will
merely mention that the Public
Information staff alone received
612 such visits in the last three
months, June, July and August.
Especially in its early stages, it is
important for Unesco to be repre-
sented at international congresses
in its various subject fields. This
has been done for over forty such
congresses in 1947 (including such
diverse bodies as the International
Congress of Microbiology, Rotary
International, thé International
Federation of Secondary School
Teachers, the International Youth 1
Hostels Federation and the Inter-
national Fédération of Library As-
sociations).
Goodwiti Turs Vital
In some ways most important or
ail are visits by high officiais of
Unesco to groups of countries. dur-
ing which ail kinds of contacts can
be made-with Govcrnment Depart-
ments, National Commissions, the
académie world, specialized na-
tional bodies, and the general pub-
lic. 1 mysetf, accompanied by mem-

as a brief visit to England. The
Assistant Director-General has just
visited Poland, and will visit Haiti
en route to Mexico. 1 am hoping
that it may be possible for one or
other of us to visit a few more
countries before the General Con-
ference. The heads and various
members of our Sections and major
projects have also paid visits to a.
large number of countries.
In addition to contacts effected
by such visits. there are others,
equally important, made in the,
course of executing our programme, j
This applies to the Field Surveys of,
the Reconstruction Section, to
those carries out by the Mass
Media Section for the Commission
on Technical Needs, to the Regional
Conferences on Fundamental
Education in China and Mexico,
and to the work of the Field
Science Co-operation Offices, in-
cluding attendance at the Belem
Conference on the Hylean Amazon.
The importance for Unesco of these
various types of field work can
hardly be over-estimated.
Summary 
of 1947
We have learnt during our first
year that Unesco has neither any
single major concrete task, nor any
single main field of activity. It is
of necessity multiform and various,
and must operate n a large num-
ber of différent fields and through
a largue number of specialized chan-
nels and particular projects. How-
ever, its different fields and sepa-
rate projects must be co-ordinated
and unified. Although much re-
mains to be done towards this end,
much has allfeady been accom-
plished.
We are ctarifying the general
ideas underiying our programme,
we have accumulated a consider-
able number of working principles
or guides to operation, and we have
made real progress in devising an
organization and methods of opera-
tion and presentation which will
promote co-ordinated and unified
working. We have succeeded in many
sections (though unfortunately not
yet in rail) in obtaining a staff
adequate to cope with our pro-
gramme. and have built up a goOO
administrative structure. We have
established many of the contacts.
which wiil enable us to decentralize
our work and to ensure that the
people of Member Nations parti-
cipate to the fullest extent in ex-
ecuting our programme. We have
repaid our loans from the United
Nations and have become financial-
ly independent. Most important or
ail. and most encouraging, we have
begun actual operation on a large
scale and have tangible achieve-
ments to show in almost every
sector of our programme, and this
in spite of having had in one year
to prepare two programmes and
two budgets. Finally, we have been
able to reach a clearer and broader
view of the task ahead of us. and
as a resuit have been able to pre-
pare for the approval of the Second
session 
of the General Conference.
a programme which 1 can con-
fidentiy asscrt is much better, both
in general scope and in its detailed
élaboration, than that presrn (pd
last November for 1947.
