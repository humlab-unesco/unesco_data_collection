Pans Newsletter Intérim Report
Director-CeneraFs Account to ECOSOC
of Organisation's Activitics, Nov., 1946-July, 1947
(An intérim report covering the activities of UnfJSco
from the first session of the General Conference in No-
vember, 1946, until June 30, 1947, was made by the Director.
General po the Economie and Social Council of the United
Nations in July.
The Director-GeneraI has since drawn up a full report
on Unesco's activities during its first year of existence,
which will be placed before the second session of the
General Conference in Mexico City in November.
It will be published in a booklet and will be reproduced
in condensed form in a forthcoming issue, of the Monitor.
The intérim report as given here has been abridged
slightly to meet space requirements and a few changes
have been made to bring it up to the present. It must
be emphasised hère that the first four months of the
pcriod covered by this report were dèvoted to work of a
preparatory nature which was necessary before Unesco
could begin operations.)
CHAPTER 1
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF UNESCO
A. The First Session of the General Conference
Convened on September 13th, 1946, by the late Miss
Ellen Wilkinson, Chairman of the Preparatory Commis-
sion, the first session of the Générai Conference of Unesco
opened in Paris on November l9th, 1946. It was attended
! by some 500 delegates, consultants and observers, repre-
 senting forty-seven states, 31 of which are now Member
States. Thc first session of the General Conference lasted
three weeks. Its agenda included the election of the
Executive Board of eighteen members provided for by the
Constitution (see list of Executive Board members a
Annex I), the appointment of the Director-GeneraI. and
the adoption of various administrative and financial re-
gulations.
But the main task of the Conference was to provide
the organisation with a programme adapted to the genecal
purposes defined in its Constitution and with a budget
i enabling it to develop its activities on the scale required.
A dérision was made to provide Unesco during its first
year of existence with a budget somewhat smaller than
. that'., ropW.. A ! d by'the Er. eparlj, tory Commission., The final
1 figure adopted by the representatives of the thirty MeàJ. ber
States amounts to 6, 950, 000 dollars, including an amount
of 950, 000 dollars covering the expenses of the Preparatory
Commission.
In addition, it was decided to set up a revolving fund
of 3. 000, 000 dollars. By a later decision of the Executive
Board, it was agreed that only 1, 000. 000 dollars of this
revolving fund wouid be collected in 1947.
As to the programme of the Organisation, the General
Conference endorsed to a large extent, although modify-
ing in some cases, the proposais submitted to it by the
Prepara tory Commission, whose preliminary studies had
covered the period between November, 1945. and Novem-
ber. 1946.Due, however, to the limited time at its disposai and
to thé 
magnitude of the field to be covered, it was not
possible for the General Conference to crystallise m ail
détails the projects to be undertaken in 1947 nor to relate
properly the plans proposed as to the financial resources
granted to the Organisation.
As a resuit, it was necessary for the Executive Board
to reconsidoc in great detail the decisions of the General
Conférence and to acc1pt responsibility for drawing up the
final plan of action ctfscrIbed in this report.
B. Administrative and Financial Planning
At the same time tnat the Executive Board adopted a
final programme for 1947, It approved a detailed budget
for the year. Thereafter it was necessary for the Ad-
ministrative and Financial Services to translate this budget
into a financial control system, by providing quarterly
 budget allotments to permit the Sections to carry out the
approved programme. The initial financing of the pro-
gramme, was in part effected by means of the loan from
the United Nations Working Capital Fund. authorised by
thp. General Assembly, which enabled Unesco to begin
active operation before contributions from its Member
States could be collected.
In addition to translating the programme, thé ad-
ministrative and financial services have been engaged in
administrative and organisational development.
Ail the foregoing has been accomplished, as provided
'in thé United Nations/Unesco Agreement. in the cl0sest
collaboration with the Unitcd Nations. Insofar as is prac-
tical, Unesco procedures and its administrative and finan-
cial planning have been gcared to thc pattern set by the
Unitnd Nations.
CHAPTER II
THE PROGRAMME OF UNESCO FOR 19<17
Thé programme of Unesco as finally adopted by its
Executive Board 
in Aprit, in its second session,'breaks
down into Lwo main groups of activities :
1. Four large-scale projects of a comprehensive nature.
2, Spfcialiscd activities within the fields of éducation,
science and culture.
1. UNESCO-WIDE PROJECTS

being undertaken by Unesco in 1947 :
A. Reconstruction ; lnd RehabiJit ; ltlon of educational,
Mientiftc and cultural lIfe in countrieo devastated by war

The summer of 1947 was marked by one of the most
oppressive heat waves ever recorded in Europe and by the
first serious beginnings of a peacefui exchange of persons,
ideaa and cultures between nations since before the war.
For thé first time in eight years, large groups of students
crossed frontiers m more or less freedom, studying the
habits and customs of lands othec than their own and
exchanging ideas with fellow students abroad ; a number
of international meetings of scientists were held ; educa-
tionists from ais parts of the world met together in
eeminars ; there were international conférences of men and
women of the theatre, the press, radio and films, con-
ferences held with the view of promoting and increasing
international understanding and co-operation.
Unesco House in Paris was something of a cross-roads
and Unesco itseif a nerve centre in these activities. During
the aweltering weeks of July and August, a number of
conférences, such as that which resulted in the plans for
creation of an International Théâtre Institute, and meet-
ings of technicians concerned with rehabilitation problems
in the war-devastated countries of the. world, were promoted
by Unesco and held at its Paris headquarters. At other
meetings in Europe and the Americas dealing with inter-
national cultural problems, Unesco was directly repre-
sented. Throughout the summer there. was a steady stream
of visitors. ranging from world-famous scientists and ex-
perts in education and the arts to eager students from
abroad, in the halls of Unesco House. Thé growing in-
terest in the aims and work of Unesco was illustrated þy
the steadily increasing volume of calls upon it for infocm-
ation and service.
Priority to Reconstruction
In its activities to date. Unesco has given a high pciority
to its programme of reconstruction and rehabilitation in
the areas of the world hardest hit by war. Thus, con-
siderable importance was attached to the meeting of ex-
perts ; called at Unesco House. August 25-30, to consider the
technical needs in press. radio and films in a dozen coun-
tries which were battlefields in the war. Voluminous and
detailed reports compiled by staff members of Unesco in
five-month field surveys formed the basis of the study and
the recommendations. This meeting is reported on Page 1
of this issue ; it will suffice hère merely to point out that,
for the first time in history, an international approach to
the problems of mass communications, with their inevita. bly
important bearing on national cultures and international
understanding, has been undertaken, and it presages the
type of work that Unesco is likely to be going into more
and more deeply in the future.
Thé meeting of international experts in thc théâtre and
fadio also-are reported on Page 2, In passing, attention
may be called to the pioneering aspects of each of these
conférence.-.. From the one, an International Théâtre In-
atitute, an unaccomplished dream in the past, appears
likely to develop into a practica) reality. From the other.
one-world radio programmes and possibly a wor ! d radio
broadcasting system under thé United Nations, appears
nearer réalisation.
Thé Summer Seminar on Education for InternatIOnal
Understanding (see Page 2 for details) brought 80 pro-
minent educators hère from aU parts of thé. would. in July
and August to consider means by which education can
best contribute to international understanding, and the
application of psychological and socio-ethnological iaeas
and methods). o the problems of international understand-
ing. This conference, at which Unesco was repre. sentcd by
staff members and for which it provided secrétariat and
other facitities. was described by thé Director-General as
"one of thé mo-st promising phases of Unesco's programme
for the promotion of international understanding,"The

Film Experts on Dcfkiencies in War-
Devastated Areas
A Unesco Fund for the assistance and development of
Pri\'3S, Radio aIld Film industries in war-devastated areas
was proposed by a commission of technical experts who
i met at Unesco House, August 25-30.
. Thé commission based its recommendation on re-
ports of Unesco field workers who had carried out a de-
tailed five-month survey of the technical needs of Mvelve
Eurajx'an and Far Eastern counbries in these mass com-
munications média.
Lack of foreign exchange for purchases in hard our-
i rency areas was the chief difficulty of post-war reconstruc-
1 tion ln the fild of mass communication. The commission,
therefore. proposcd that governments of the countries con-
cerned be askcct : 0 allocate a percentage of foreign ex-
1 change reSOllrces available ror imports to () requirements or

Surveys were carried out in France, Belgium, Luxem-
bourg, Holland, Nor : way. Denmark, Poland. Czechoslovakia,
Greece, Chll1a and thé Philippines, and the replies to de-
! tailed questionnaires were studied at the conférence by
tl1l'ee sub-commissions of mtf'l11ational experts on press.

The sub-commission on Prcss rccomrnended that. to at-
levlatc the present world shortage of newsprint, more coal

more equitable distribution be made of existing paper
stocks.
Thé M condition and short supp ! y of matrices presented
the most severe problem in equipment. It was recom-
mended that Unesco contact mwuL\cturers with a view to
crcating a standard type font. to bc named"Unesco."
Thc. sub-commission on Radio recommended that the
sum of $15. 400000 be alhwated for the réhabilitation of
radio equipment in devastated areas. Of this sum. over
$13, 000000 should be d'-stributed bet, ween Grcece, Paland,

Experts jrom 16 Nations'
Confier 
on 
Werld Radio
-
At the International Radio Net-
work Conference held at Unesco
House, August 4-9, radio experts
from sixteen countries voted against
the settin up of a Unesco World
Radio Network, declaring such a
project to be neither desirable nor
practical at this time.
Thé main arguments against the
proposai. were the high initial cost
of installing equipment, lack. of
trained personnel and the difficulty
in obtaining frequeneies.
It was-decided that Unesco should
accept membership in the Radio
Board of the proposed United Na-
tions network and help govern its
programme policy in the fields of
science, education and culture.
Plans for the United Nations net-
work are now complete. They in-
volve building a chain of radio
stations around the world, and the
initial cost is estimated at six
million dollars, with an annual
maintenance expenditure of $500, 000
to t750, 000. Working on not more
than a dozen freouencies, the net-
work would supplément broadcasts
of member nations, distributing
continuous'information both by
"live"and recorded programmes
from bwenty United Nations infor-
mation centres located in Vd1'ÌOUS
parts of the globe.
The ultimate'aim is to broadcast
daily, in about twentv-five langu-
ages, programmes planned by ex-
perts of many nations. The United
Nations Assembly will vote on the
question of providing funds for this
projet.
The Conference agreed that if
the proposed United Nations net-
work should not be established, the
question of the Unesco network
should be re-examined. It was urged
at the conference that Unesco
should collaborate as fully as pos-
sible. with existing radio organisa-
tions of member states."Flying
squads"of radio technicians and
programme experts should be form-
ed who, working in liaison with
Unesco and the existinx networks.
would advise"on scientific and cul-
tural broadcasts and the exchange
of material on an international
basis.
It was further proposed khat a
panel of experts, il1l'iLed from
eighteen member na tiOt's. shollId 1
form a programme-plann. ng com-
mittee which would mee. annuatiy
in Paris and advise Unesco through
the General Conference, of its re-
commendations regarding pro-
gramme planning and police in re-
lation to broadcasts over the U. N.
network. This committce would
also advise on the prOblems arising
from internatio : 1al exchange of
such broadcast material.

M. Péon Blum
M. Léon Blum, former Prime
Minister of 
France and President
of thé first Gênerai Conference oj
Unesco, described the condition. !
necessary for the foundation of a
true and stable peace, in an adores1
at the Unesco Summer Seminar al
Sèvres on August 12.
He said there was a certain period
at the end of total wars when, as
though touched with a magic wand,
governments and peoples were
ready and determined to do as
much for peace as they did for vic-
tory. But the period in which
everything seemed possible was
short and once again in our hfe-
time we had missed thé opportunity
and must now take the s ! o\v, labor-
ious way of co-operating in the
uncertain and difficult task of
organising peace and founding an
international community of people.
M. Blum, who was introdueed by
Dr. Howard E. Wilson, said that
the first condition for the welding
together of an international society
and the foundation of a true and
stable peace consisted in the world-
, wide dissemination and the univer-
sal acceptance of poJitica ! demo-
cracy in its ideological, rather than
its constitutional, form.
"The second preliminary and
necessary condition for effective
international organisation is the
undertaking in which you are al
this very moment directly co-operat-
ing,"M. Blum saiù,"I mean a
common and universal effort by
each nation and between aU nations
in the fields of education, science
and culture. Education both for the
child and the adult : culture both
for the individuel and for the mul-
titude : the increase of research and
scientific knowledge throughout
the world, in ail its forms and as-
pets. This is thé essentiai aim of
Unesco, under whose auspices l'OU
are met together."

Plans for the inauguration of an
International Theatre Institute
were drawn up by a committee of
theatre experts from Europe, the
Americas and the Far East who met
under the auspices of Unesco ln
Paris from July 28 to August 1.
In their judgment that an Inter-
national Théâtre Institute was both
désirable and necessary, the theatre
experts were supported by numer-
ous endorsements of colleagues,
theatre associations, and press com-
ments throughout the, would.
Under the chairmanship of Mr.
J. B. Priestly (United Kingdom).
the meeting drew up a draft Char-
ter for trie Institute. thé purpose
of which is to promote the inter-
national exchange of knowledge
and practice in theatre arts. The
draft charter states that in order
to achieve this, the Institute will
provide a centre for the coJJection
and dissemination of ait types of
theatrical information, handle all
types of international theatre ex-
change, and issue publications to
facilitate the aims of the Insti-
tute.
It was agreed that an Interna-
tional Theatre Congress shnuld be
caHed in the late spring of 1948.
The Congrcss. composed of dele-
gates from the various national
centres, will discuss the Institu : e's
charter and determine wavs and
means of launching the Institute's
programme.
Arrangements are ah'eady under
way for the creation of such centres

obstacles to the free flow of inter-
national artistic exchange and the
immediate and long-range relation-
ship between Unesco and the I. T. I.
It was recommended that certain
immediate steps be taken to faci-
litate the international exchange
and movement of acting companies,
playscripts and spécifie kinds of
theatrical information. For this pur-
pose questionnaires were prepared
to be sent to the various national
centres.
Points raised by the questionnaires
include terms under which theatres
may be made available to visit : ng
companies, the conditions of travel
within the country of visit and the
types of censorship. Lists of exist-
ing theatre houses, both state-sub-
sidised and private, nationaj profes-
sional organisations such as labour
unions, and non-professional and
non-governmental theatre organisa-
tions, are also requested.
A Provisional Executive Cotnmit-

pots among governments and ori-
vate. groups, one of Unesco's initial
tanks is to co-ordinate and stimulate
campaigns under way, as will as to
act as an international clearing
bouse for the exchange of informa-
tion on techniques, materials and
experts available in this field.
The Fundamental Education
. Programme for 1947 includes three
pilot projects for the experimental
application of fundamental educa-
tion techniques. These projects
bave been undertaken at the invita-
tion of the governments concerned,
and will be conducted with the
advice and guidance of a Unesco
consultant. Discussions are proceed-
ing rapidly towards commencing
operations of these proiects-in
Haiti and China as wei ! as in the
Tanganyika and Nyasaland areas
of British East Afriea. In addition.
the Hylean Amazon project, which
is discussed elsewhere, also includes
the study of fundamental education
problems in the area.
A group of experts in fundamen-
tal education, was convened by
Unesco in Aptil, 1947 and has prod-
uced a series of recommendations
for the guidance of the programme
m this field. A meeting of experts
in language problems in fundamen-
tal education was held for'for
days at the end of June.
A, régional study conference, con-
sisting of representatives of Far
Eastern countries and Non-SeIf-
Governing territories was held
m Nanking frocs September Ist to
12th.
C. Education for International
Understanding
This project, which has a con-
tinuing character, includes eight
distinct, but closply eorrelated. activ-
ities in its 1947 phase :-
(i) An analysis of the mcthods
used for developing international
understanding in primary schools.
secondary schools. and insu'utes of
higher éducation.
(ii) A seminar for icachers to
discuss education for international
understanding. This was held in
Paris during July and August.
Unesco's Member States and coun-
tries which have signed but not
yet ratified Unesco's Constitution.
as well as those which have applied
for membership, designated leading
educators to attend theseminarj
and cxchange ideas on technique
and teaching for international un-
derstanding.
(ici) A study of materials and
techniques which are used in aduit
education for developing interna-
tional goodwill.
. (fiv) Assistance to international
relations clubs organised for the
etudy of world affairs.
(v) A draft model of textbook
analyses with a view to encouraging
governments. educational author-
tties and schools to intprove text-
books and teaehing materials as
aids to increasing understanding
tmongpeopies.
(vi) A survey ôf the conditions
under which exchange of persons
contributes to mutuai respect and
understanding among peoples.
(vil) Development of the pro-
gramme for cxchange of personnel
on a large scalp, so that thc former-
ly occupied countries may bencfit
from régent dcvctopmcnts in other
parts of the would. This is intc-
grated in Unesco's fciiowship pro-
gramme.

It is contemplated that, f estab-
llshed, the International Institute
of the Hylean Amazon might serve
as a clearing house for scientific
information emanating from the
region and could correlate the acti-
vities of scientific expéditions ex-
ploring the area. Ultimately, inter-
national research groups would at-
tack the innumerable scientlfic and
social problems of the Amazon.
Their findings will be made avail-
able to the world so that both the
Amazon area and thé outside worid
will derive mutual benefit.
2. SPECIALISED ACTIVITIES
IN THE FIELDS OF EDUCATION,
SCIENCE AND CULTURE
Education
Besides the Fundamental Educa-
tion Programme and Education for
International Understanding, Un-
esco is encouraging and aromoting
adult education programmes, par-
ticularly by collecting and uissemin-
ating information on new methods
and by studying techniques and the
i sociological background d adult
éducation and its relation to school
éducation. The possibility of set-
ting up. an international associa-
tion for adult education is under
consideration and plans are being
made for an international confer-
ence of adult education experts, to
b :) held in 1948.
Unesco Member States and other
intergovernmental organisations
may now seek advice from Unesco
on gênerai questions relating to the
collection, interprétation and dis-
semination of statistical data on
education.
Natural Sciences
Natural Sciences play a major
rôle in the reconstruction and
reha bili ta tion project, pa,'ticularly
in relation to scientific a :'. d tech-
nical schools, colleges, universities
and research institutes in the war-
devastated areas. Thé programme
for distribution of scientilie and
technical apparatus has neen in-
tpgratpd into this Unpsco-'A'ide pro-
gramme.
However, the major speciiie acti-
vity being undertaken here is the
establishment of Field Science Co-
operation Offices in locations re-
mote from the would centers of !
science and technology. These
offices are designed to facilitate
contact bctween scientists and tech-
nologists in various parts of thé'
world to assist in the solution ouf
problems of scientific literature.
translations and reprints and to
facilit. ate the exchange of scient, fic
personnel in the areas concerne,
The offices will serve as reception
and distribution offices for scienti-
fic information particularly of i
problems indigenous to the région.
In addition to the office alreóldy
established in the Hylean Amazon,
two more are located in t. he Far
East and the Middle East. An of-
fice in South Asia will b estab-
lished in 1948.

Arts and Letters
The Arts and Letters Programme
includes projects in the fjelds of
literature and theatre as well as
music and the visual arts.
In the field of literature, a con-
sultant has been appointed to lead
an investigation of world literary
journals with a view to creating
an exchange centre for all types
of literary material, thus promot-
ing greater understanding between
peoples through world-wide inter-
change of works. Material for an
anthology of works of writers who
suffered under Axis occupation
will be collectes through interna-
tional associations and the National
Commissions of Unesco.
i The 1947 General Conférence wu
alto be presented with the outline
of a plan designed to place the
methods and achievements of those
countries where the arts are uses
to full advantage in gênera ! éduca-
tion at the disposai of those na-
tions where the arts are not so
advantageously utilised.
Libraries and Museums
During 1947, the major interest
has been in library recons'. ruction,
with special emphasis on thé needs
of public libraries, and the crémation
of public libraries in countries with
undeveloped systems. Grat pro-
gress has been made in establishing
accurate information on needs and
resources and in assisting inter-
library cxchanges and con'. acts. In
co-operation with the Reconstruction
project t. wo questionnaires have
been sent out since Apri !, and a
monthly Unesco Bulletin for Libra-
ries has been issued. 5, 0'JO copies
being distributed in 61 cOill1tries.
In February, 1947, Unesco took
over the Inter-Allied Book Centre :
and the liquidation pf its'lc, sets was :
undertaken.
The Unesco Book Coupon Scheme
has been oudined in a document
which has been circulaloo :. 0 Mem-
ber States and which was (I, SCUSSOO
at a meeting of the International
Federation of Library Associations
in May. It is possible that the
scheme may be operated experi-
mentally in a sample area so that
specific evidence of its feasibility
wiil be avaiinble for the General
Conference.
Mass Communication
This programme is divided mto
three parts, one dealing with film, s,
one with radio and one !.'with the
press. Its major interests break
down into the following catégories :
1. The free flow of information
and the removal of barriers ;
2. Commission on Technical
Needs ;
3, Exchange of persons and in-
formation.
In the field which perta'rs to the
free no\\'of information, Unesco
has been represented and nas pre-
sented its views at a number of
international conférences and other
meetings, such as the United Na-
tions Sub-Commission on Freooom
of Information and the Press. the
International Télécommunications
Union Conférence and the Univer-

1. Translation of the Classlcs
The second part of the first ses-
sion of the General Assembly re-
solved to turn over to Unesco, for
"suitable action,"the proposai for
the translation of the world's
classics into the various languages
of the Member States of the United
Nations. The Economic and Social
Council approved and supported
this action by the General Assemble.
As a result of this series of resolu-
tions, Unesco is now engaged In
preliminary research on th : s subjeet.
A request for recommendations and
participation in this pro. tect bas
been addressed to aU Members of
the United Nations. During 1948
Unesco will furnish a detailed re-
por : on this sub. ject to the United
Nations.
2. Fl'eedom of Information
Unesco's Général Conférence in
1946 resolved that Unesco would
coliaborate as fully as possible with
the United Nations in the organisa-
tion and work of the World Confer-
ence on Freedom of Information
and the Press, which will be held
in 1948, A Unesco representative
participated in the first session of
the Sub-Commission on Freedom
of Information, which met at Lake
Success in May, 1947, to ùraw up
the'agenda for the World Confer-
ence. Unesco has l} ndertaken to
assist the United Nations Secre : a-
riat in the preparation of documen-
tation for thé Conférence and will
provide an expert who will, work
fui) time at Lake Success with the
Secretariat in this matter.
3 Bill of Human Rights
After consultation with the Chair-
man of the United Nations Com-
mission on Human Rights, an
enquiry on the philosophie aspects
of a déclaration on human rights
has been made in the form of a
questionnaire which has been cir-
culated to a list of people through-
out the world whose interests com-
prise a wide range of activities. A
drafting committee met in Paris al
the end of July, 1947, to d :'aw up a
report on the matte.
A Unesco representative"'as pres-
ent at the session of the Commis-
sion on Human Rights Committee
which was set up to draft'he Bill
of Rights.
The results of Unesco's enquiry
into this question and its conclu-
sions have been made available to
the United Nations for thé infor-
mation and use of the Commission
n Human Rights.
4. Education for Womcn
The Commission on the Status of
Womcn has rcqucsted Unesco to
pay particular attention in its edu-
'ational programme to those areas
. vherc \l'omen do not presentIy have
'quasi rights. Unesco'is vitally in-
cerestcd in this question and re-
'ommrndations in this field will be

to participate with thé United Na
tions in the study of this question1
and will hope to play a major role
in its eventual realisation.
6. Fellowships
As one of the best means of en-
couraging understanding between
peoples, Unesco has a vital interest
in the whole field of exchange of
personnel, fellowships and grantlloi
in-aid.
In conjunction with the other
Specialised Agencies, and perhaps
as a participant in a possible eo.
ordinating committee, Unesco wiU
work intcnsive) y with thé United
Nations in this field. In Unesco's
case, it is presently bc-Iieved, t, hat
thé work should be largely a mat-
ter of stimulation and cl-ordinal
tion. Informat enquiries have been
instituted as to a possible survey of
exchanges of persons conducted
throughout the world.
Unesco is already prcparing to
allocate a considerable number of
feliawships. which have been offer-
ed by the following :
2 Fellowships offered by the Ro-
tary International ;'
5 Fellowships offered by BeJgium :
20 Fellowships offered by the
French Ministry of Education ;
10 Film and 5 Press Fellowships
offered by the British Ministry of
Education.
7. Utilisation by Unesco of thé.
Assets of the Internationa ! tnstt-
tute of intellectuel Coopération.
In accordance with a rrsolutiori
adopted by the General Assembly
on the 19th of November. 1946, the
United Nations Educational, Scien-
tific and Cultural Organisa ion was
authorised by the United Nations
to utilise the assets of thé* Inter-
national Institute of Intel : edual
Co-operation aster its dissolution,
which became effective on the 31st
of December. 1946.
Moreover. the General A. s.- ; embly's
résolution laid down that Unesco
should make such use of these as-
sets as would ensure the continuity
of the work done by the Interna-
tional Institute of Intellectual Co-
opération. It will be : emembered
that Article 2 of the Agreement
between the Instituts and Unesco
stipulates the following :
"Within the framework of the pro-
"gramme ; to be adopted bv the
"General Conference at its First
"Session, the United Nations Edu-
"cational, Scientific and Cultural
"Organisation hall endeavour to
"ensure the continuity of work done
"by the International Institute of
"Intellectual Co-operation since
"1924, and. in particular, to com-
"plete certain tasks undertaken by
"the Institute, as far as the Gen-
"eral Conference considers it advis-
"able."
Among United Nations projects'
in which Unesco has an interest,
action has been as follows :
1. Housing and Town Planninr
The Unesco 1946 General Confer-
ence directed that Unesco should
enter into this field in the closest
consultation with the Economie
and Social Council and suggested
that consideration should be given
to the possible setting up of an
international housinj1 information
centre.
A Unesco consultant met at Lake
Success during May with the mem-
bers of the United Nations Secreta-
riat concerned with setting up a
housing and town planning section
in the Department of Social Af-
fairs. It was mutually agreed t. hat
Unesco's primary function in this
field shouid be to educate the
people of the world to underst. and
and bclicve in the need for housing
and town planning and that
Unesco might well become the
sentire for dissemination of infor-
mation. The International Federa-
Lion for Housing and Town Plain-
ning. which met at Unesco House
n June emphasised parLlcularly
Lhc pnssibility of Unesco t. aking
part in the training and education

'orld, with particular regard to

of providing space

; cntati\'es of thé United Nations
; ecrctarint and othcr Speciallsed
agencés as to the formulating of
hc programme for this Conférence,
vhich is to be held in 19M.
Unesco's interest in this eonfe1'o

be carried out by thé organisations.
which contribute to the 1 purpoøea
and programme of Unesco' ; grant
of facUities ln the nature of'o ! ! lce
space,. secrétariat 1 services., srral) ge-
ments for meetings, documentation,
etc., and exchange of information
and material.
It is finaux provided that, in ac-
cordance with Article XI of the
Unesco Constitution, the relations
between Unesco and non-Govern-
mental Organisations may be estab-
lished on the basis of formai agree-
ments or working arrangements.
Formai agreements will be required
whenever questions of financial
support or the grant of facilities
such as the provision of office
space, and secrétariat assistance
are involved. Such agreements
will be submitted for the approval
of the Executive Board, and before
they are concluded, the Economie
and Social Council of the United
Nations will have to be informed
of their nature and scope. Work-
ing arrangements will be made by
the Director-General.
During recent months. Unesco
has deveioped its relations with
non-Governmentai Organisations on
the lines set out in the above di-
rective and has succeeded in as-
sociating very closely with its
activities a number of bodies whose
contributions towards the fulfil-
ment of the general aims and pur-
poses defined by the Unesco Con-
stitution can be a major one.
An important development to
record here is the setting up of a
Temporary International Council
for Educational Reconstruction.
This Council's main functions are
to advise Unesco in the execution
of its programme of educationa ! re-
construction, and to provide a
framework within which the efforts
of Unesco and of international
non-Governmental Organisations
active in the fields of educational,
scientific and cultural reconstruc-
tion can be developed to the fullest
possible extent by means of com-
mon planning, adequate allocat. on
of responsibilities and close co-or-
dination.
The terms of référence of the
statute of this Advisory Council
 have been discussed at two prel'.-
minary meetings which hâve taken
place at Unesco House in Paris on
February 13th-15th and May 21st-
: l2nd, 1947, These meetings were
attended by thé représentatives of
1 al ! the leading non-Governml'ntal
Organisations which. sinel'thl'war,
have deveioped activities in this
fiel.
t In addition, an intérim expert
committee has bcen formed wlthin
thé Councii.
Unesco, at present has \\'orking
frelations with some 120 non-Gov-
ernmental Organisations. Formai
: agreements will be concludcd with
! a certain number of thcm.
Two such agreements are already
in force. The first. which wa. s ap-
proved by thé Général Conférence
in its lrst session, relates Unesco
to the International Councii of
Sctcnnfic Unions, whicll. for many
ycar, has associated. acr. Ms fron-
tiers. thé leading scientists ot thé
world. This agreement ha. enab !-
ed Unesco to give efficient support

wor_injt arrangements will provl4e
for the adequate participation or
non-Governmental International
Organisations in certain acttvities
of Unesco, as well as for their re-
presentation at the sessions of the
General Conference. However, the
final decision as to participation of
an observer from a non-Govern-
mental International organisation
in the General Conference resta
with the Conference itself, voting
by a two-thirds majority on the
recommendations of the Executive
Board.
Plans are already being consider-
ed for ensuring an adequate parti-
cipation of the main organisations
with which Unesco is related at the
second session of the General Con-
férence. which will review recent
developments that have taken place
in this field in 1947 and decide
upon Hie policy to be fo) ! owed in
the future.
CONCLUSION
At the time of preparing this
report, Unesco is already weH en-
gaged in the préparation of the
second session of its General Con-
ference and in the drawing up of
its programme of work for 1948,
The first outline of the ! atter was
discussed by the Executive Board
of Unesco at the end of July. As
soon as the proposais to be sub-
mitted for discussion to the next
General Conference are available,
they will be communicated to the
United Nations or their informa-
tion. It can be said, however, at
this stage, that to a large extent
the programme of 1948 will aim at
continuing and expanding activities
initiated in 1947. In addition, the
programme wilJ inc1ude a numOer
of new projects. A special effort
will be made to build up Unesco's
programme as an organic whole
directed toward the promotion of
peace, the fundamentai purpose as-
signed to the Organisation by its
Constitution.
It is ant'. cipated that the second
session of thé Gênerai Conférence,
which will open 111 Mexico City on
November 6th, will mark an impor-
tant stage in the strengthening of
the Organisation, the development
of its activities and particularly
the extension of its programme into
net areas of the world.
During the tour which the Di-
rector-General made m June
through Latin-America. ncws was
received that most Latin-American
Republics plan to participate fully
in the Conference itself and in
the exhibits which arme', 0 be or-
ganised on this occasion.
lu addition to thé 31 states
which are members of thé Orgam-
sation at the present date, it is an-
ticipated that a number of addi-
tional countries, which have not
yet accepted the Constitution, wiil
hâve joined thé Organisation by
November. and will thus take part
in the Conference with full voting
rights for the first time. Invita-
tions will further be sent to states
such as Austria. Itaiy and Switzer-
land. which requested to join the
Organisation and whose applIca-
tions have been approved by the
Economie and Social Council and
will be voted upon in Mexico.
Thus the Mexico Conference will
mark a milestone in the hislory of
Unesco.

The New York Office is a per-
manent installation at the head-
quarters of the United Nations,
and its representatives perform day-
to-day liaison between Unesco and
the United Nations, as well as re-
presenting Unesco at the meeting&
listed, or assisting special represen-
tatives. The office also includes a
permanent officiai whose sole func-
tion is liaison with the United
Nations Department of Public In-
formation.
2. Inter-Secrtetariat Coperation.
Co-ordination Committee
Unesco participates actively ln
the work of the Co-ordination Com-
mittee which has been set up by
the Secretary-General and which is
composed of the Directing Authori-
ties of each of the Specialised
Agencies. The work of'. his com-
mittee consists of co-ordinating the
activities of the United Nations and
the various Specialised Agencies,
particularly in the administrative
and technical fields. Dr. Julian
Huxley, Director-General of Unesco,
participated in the meeting of the
Co-ordination Committee which was
held, and the Head of Unesco's
New York Office participated in
the meetings of the committee's
working group. Unesco also parti-
cipates in the foMowing consulta-
tive committees. ail of which are
part of the gcneral framework of
co- {) rdination at the Secretariat
level :
1Dcpartment of Public Information
Unesco participâtes actively in
the United Nations Film Board as
wu as the Consultative Commit-
tee in Public Information. Since
both of these aspects of the work
of thé Department of Public In-
formation are pcculiarly within the
competence of Unesco, it is hopcd
that Unesco mav share equaiiy with
thé United Nations in thé work of
these two bodies. Liaison with thé
D. P. I. is maintained through a re-
presentative of the Unesco Secreta-
riat who is permanently stationed
at an office in thé D. P. I. at Lake

CHAPTER IV
UNESCO AND THE OTHER
SPECtAUSKD AGENCn : S
Since the initial stage of Unesco's
Preparatory Commission, close con-
tact ha. s been maintained with
othcr mlcrna ! ional organisation"
thon in proccss of becoming asso-
ciated with the United Nations as
Spccialised Agencies.
Through mutual rcprcscntation at
conferences, regular exchange of
documentes, and fréquent contact,
aL the Secretariat level, care was
taken tn avoid dup'. iration of effort

2. Relation with the Intemational
Labour Orranisation
Informait conversations have al-
ready permitted clarification of re-
lations between the I. L. O. and
Unesco. Areas of common lnterest
lie. in the first instance, in the
field of vocational guidance, adult
education and fundamental educa-
tion. In addition, Unesco is most
interested in the experience which
the I. L. O. has gained in work with
and on behalf of non-sèlf-governing
territories. It is proposed to main-
tain close contact between respon-
sible members of the two Secreta-
riats working along thesc various
lines.
A draft agreement has been
drawn up by the two Secretariats,
which, it is hoped, will be ready for
submission to the directing bodies
of the I. L. O. and Unesco towards
the end of the year. Witti a view
to harmonising as far as possible
the bilateral relations of Specialis-
ed Agencies. it has been decided to
follow, in drawing up this drift,
the pattern of the agrément ail-
ready concluded between the I. L. O.
and the F. A. O.
The draft tentatively agreed upon
by the Secretariat provides for gen-
éral co-operation and consultation
in regard to matters of eommon in-
terest. reciprocal representation at
meetings, exchange of information
and documents, as well as for co-
ordination in'administrative mat-
ters. Provision is made for the
setting up of joint committees to
handie any question of common in-
terest which may require co-opera-
tive action. This draft also will
be submitted to the Economic and
Social Council.
3. Relations with the Food
and Agricutture Organization
Negotiations with the F. A. O. are
not quite as advanced yet but full
care has been taken in shaping
Unesco's programme to avoid any
interference in the field of work
assigned po F. A. O. by its constitution.
This Organisation has been in-
formed of ail aspects of Unesco's
programme, especially in the scien-
tific field, which involves problems
in which it is Ukeiy to be of con-
cern. There again a draft agree-
ment is under consideration and it
is hoped that it will be concluded
before the end of the year.
- 1. Relations with other
Specialised Agencies
Without concludmg formai agrec-
ments when it is not required by
close community of interests.
Unesco fil ! remain in regular con-
tact with the other Specialised
Agencies of the United Nations,
such as the Universal Postal Union,
thé Internationai Refugee Organi-
sation. thé Intprnationai Bank for
Reconstruction and Dcvelopment.
and thé International Monetary
Fund.

At such time as the Secretary-
General of the United Nations may
eet up an advisory committee to
draw up the agenda for the Con-
férence. Unesco will hope to parti-
cipate actively in its work, as wel !
as eventua ! ! y in the Confeence it-
self.
S. Codification of International
Law.
Throughcorrespondence and per-
sonal contacts with organisations
and institutions in the legal field,
Unesco is investigating the possib-
ilitie of action in the fietd of com-
parative law, so far as this action
may be compatible with the work
of the United Nations Committee
on Codification of International
Law.
In accordance with whatever re-
commendations in that regard may
be made by the United Nations
. Committee 
on Codification of Inter-
national Law, Unesco wiil hope'o
co-operate in the necessary re-
search and other activities in this
tield.
4. Social Wetfare.
Unesco has an interest in many
parts of the United Nations Sochl
Welfare Programme, which is pecu-
liarly the province of the Social
Commission of the Economie and
Social Council.
Unesco's particular interest lies
in the field of fellowships and ex-
change of personnel. However,
Unesco is also actively interested
in the question of youth guidance,
child wrlfare, prevention of crime
and treptment of deHnquents, train-
ing of handicappcd children, and
vocational training. ActuaIIy. in
view of its Constitution ùt objec-
tives, Unesco has an over-all inte-
rest in this field, insofar M it per-
tains to bettering standards of liv-
ing throughout the world by assist-
ance to special groups, and insofar
as it contributes to mutual bcttcr-
ment and understanding among
peoplps.
5. Passeport and Frontier Forma.
litiges.
The easing of passport and fron-
tier formatities will obviousty faci-
litate exchange of persons travel-
ling on fellowships as well as ex-
change of scicntists, artists. edu-
cators and others who can spread
Unesco's aims and idcats through-
out the world. Unesco is particu-
larly interested in faci'itating'hc
free flow of educational, scientific
and cultural materials by lowering
tarifs, postal rates, facilitating
means of transportation, etc.
From thèse aspects Unesco will
hope to participato actively in the
forthcoming United Nations Confer-
ence on Pas-sport and Frontier For-
malities and in any work of the
proposed International Trade Or-
ganisation which will deal with ta-
riffs. customs b, uriers, etc"as they
pertain to educational. scientifi' :
and cultural materials.
CHAPTER III

The agacement between Unesco
and the United NaLi'Jns enL ('1' ('d
