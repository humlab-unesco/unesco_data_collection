                    an Acting Director-General to exercise the functions of the Director-General
                    until the following General Conference. If the General Conference endorses the

                    terminated forthwith, and the Executive Board shall be requested to make a new

10.12 The General Conference,
       Noting that it is desirable that the United Nations and the other Specialized Agencies should

       tions similar to those of the United Nations, in which the fundamental obligations and rights
       of staff members are the same,

       regards the obligations and rights of the members of the staff of the Organization will be in
       accord with that of the United Nations and of the other Specialized Agencies,

       report, together with the comments of the Executive Board on the measures taken in the

                     ment or for war service. He may authorize the acceptance of honours and prizes from
                     educational, scientific or cultural organizations and the acceptance of remuneration
                     for work done by a member of the Secretariat in his spare time provided that such work
                     is not incompatible with his status as an international Civil Servant.

11.    Contribution of Gandhian outlook and techniques to the solution of tensions among and within
       nations (2 XC/9)
       The General Conference,
       Decides to refer to the Executive Board and to the Director-General the report of the
       Seminar on the Contribution of Gandhian outlook and techniques to the solution of tensions
       within and among nations, for study of the possibilities of implementation of the measures
       proposed by the Indian Government in the draft programme for 1955-56.
                                                                                         Fifth plenary meeting,

12.     Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind
        The General Conference,
        Noting the difficulties which have been encountered in obtaining funds, from extra-budgetary
        sources, for the International Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind,
        Requests the Director-General and the Executive Board to examine the possibility of finding
        such additional funds as may be essential for the continuation of this project in 1954 by a
       transfer within the existing budgetary appropriations,
        Decides that transfers within the budget to replace withdrawals from the working capital
        fund shall not be considered possible unless the essential requirements of the International
        Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind have been met.
                                                                                         Sixth plenary meeting,
                                                                                         3 July 1953.
13.     Unesco Headquarters (2 XC/3 and Addendum)
        Whereas at its Seventh Session the General Conference authorized the Director-General by
        resolution 29 to proceed with arrangements for a preliminary plan for the construction of the
        Permanent Headquarters building,
        Considering that the French Government has undertaken to grant permanently to Unesco the
        privileges and immunities necessary for the exercise of its functions and to grant to it the
        right to acquire free of all taxes and duties all necessary material, equipment and services
        in France and also to import necessary equipment and material free of duty,
        Recalling the very generous offer made by the French Government of a site and an interest-
        free loan for 30 years as set out in the communication of 23 June 1951 (6C/ADM/16 Annex I),
        Considering the Report and Recommendations of the Headquarters Committee in document
        2 XC/3 and having examined the preliminary plan prepared by Messrs. Breuer. Nervi and
        Zehrfuss (2 XC/Z) and the Report of the International Panel of Five Architects (2 XC/Z,
        Annex III),
        The General Conference
13.1    Authorizes the Director-General
13.11   To accept the offer of the site made by the French Government and to negotiate and execute
        a lease relating thereto;
13.12   To accept the offer of the loan from the French Government and subject to any directions
        given by the General Conference to work out with the French authorities a schedule for ad-
        vance and reimbursements and to negotiate and execute any necessary contracts relating
        thereto;
13.13   To approve the preliminary project for the Permanent Headquarters of Unesco presented by
        the three architects, Messrs. Breuer, Nervi and Zehrfuss, to adopt the final project and to
        proceed with the construction at a total cost not to exceed $6, 000, 000, this sum to include
        all irrecoverable expenditure made up to date and administrative and other costs;
13.14 To purchase, at a cost not to exceed $1,080,000, the additional equipment and material
        needed to put the building in working order;

           tions from certain Member States or within the budget provided for this item in the building
           estimates;

 13.3      Authorizes the Director-General to ask Member States whether they wish to present the

OPENING OF THE SESSION BY THE HEAD OF THE INDIAN DELEGATION
(1) The PRESIDENT - Fellow delegates, I have great pleasure in extending to you all a very hearty
welcome to this Second Extraordinary Session of the General Conference. Since we last met, Spain,
Nepal and Libya have ratified our Constitution and have now become full Members.
(2) This special session is convened as a result of developments which happened at the last session,
due to Dr. Torres Bodet’s resignation. I wish to take this opportunity to pay my tribute to his great
qualities. He was a dedicated man, devoted to the work of international understanding and world
peace. Whatever we may feel about his resignation, we were all impressed by his unselfishdevotion
to the cause of Unesco. Simple in his personal life, industrious to a fault, he had a burning faith in
Unesco’s mission and a compelling resolution that it should succeed. Wherever he may be, I have
no doubt that he will continue to serve the cause of world peace and international understanding.
(3) The choice of a successor is not an easy task. We require a man of great academic eminence,
intellectual integrity and, above all, faith in Unesco. The Executive Board will present to you pro-
posals which will come up for our consideration later. In the meantime, Dr. Taylor has been carry-
ing on the work of Unesco with great ability and skill, as the report on the activities of this Organi-
zation in the period from November 1952 to April 1953 clearly indicates.
(4) From the agenda you will see that the Governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia wish to with-
draw from membership of Unesco. At the last session, a similar proposal was made by the Polish
Government and the Executive Board passed a resolution requesting the Polish Government “to re-
consider its decision, and to resume its full collaboration in the Organization’s activities”. A
similar resolution, addressed to the Governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia will come up for
our consideration.
(5) In recent weeks there have been several indications which suggest a change in the mood and
manner and, I hope, in the mind and heart, of Soviet Russia and her friends. We seek and invite
their co-operation in the work of Unesco. All the peoples of the world ardently yearn for peace and
all governments proclaim their desire for peace. Peace is not merely the absence of hostilities; it

  III-I                                        Plenary Meetings
  is the strengthening of a positive fellow-feeling; it is an appraisal of the ideas and ideals, of the
  anxieties and aspirations of other peoples, and if we become universal our effectiveness will in-
  crease. To the extent to which we are not universal, our effectiveness will be diminished. So we
  seek the co-operation of all nations, and we ask them to come here and collaborate with us, reduce
  tensions, increase fellow-feeling and strengthen world-mindedness. World-mindedness is the real
  need of the times. The world has grown small and we must learn to live together. If we do not
  learn to do so, we shall perish together. In this world there are twelve hundred millions of people,
  hungry, naked, illiterate, imprisoned in both mind and soul. And the others are living in a climate
  of fear, suspicion and selfishness which they call patriotism. Unless we are able to bring the two
  sections together and raise the status of the exploited and under-privileged nations, it will not be
  possible for us to remove the threat to peace.
  (6) The League of Nations was founded with the idea of promoting international collaboration and
  avoiding the scourge of war; but the powers that had the leadership in the League mishandled the
  situation and put their national interests above moral law and principle, and we were led to a state
  of war. Today, we must learn from that warning and avoid the pitfalls which beset the League of
  Nations. If we protect privilege, if we support reaction, if we ally ourselves with corrupt and un-
  representative administrations, if we mistake stability for the maintenance of present conditions, if
  we give the impression that we are interested in the “status quo”, we will not remove the fears and
  pressures that led to two wars in a single generation. It is essential for us to realize that freedom
  is indivisible. We cannot have freedom in one country and deny it to others. We cannot have freedom
  in political matters and deny it in social, economic and cultural affairs.
  (7) The spirit of man had to emancipate itself from the shackles of authority, religious and political.
  Today, we cannot be sure that the spirit of man feels itself to be genuinely free. There are open
  enemies of freedom and they did not end when the Second World War was concluded. There are
  secret unseen enemies, there are deluded, unconscious enemies who suppress freedom in the belief
  that they are safeguarding freedom.
  (8) It is essential for us to realize that if freedom is to be saved, we must have the courage to fight
  its battles. If eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, this is a time when we have to be vigilant, so
  far as the encroachments on freedom are concerned.
  (9) Some take the view that man must be regarded as merely flesh and bone, an instrument of the
  God-state. We do not share that view in this Organization. We believe that man is a spiritual being.
  He is not satisfied with what he sees or what he hears. He wishes to establish contact with another
  and unseen world which transcends this particular world of ours. It is essential that the unity of
  mankind be created, not by the blood and treasure which we waste on battlefields, but by the develop-
  ment of truth and virtue, which we build up in the hearts and minds of men.
  (10) So far as this Organization is concerned, we must lay stress on what may be regarded as its
  international bias and direction. Nationalism and internationalism are not to be regarded as incon-
  sistent with each other. Humanity is not an abstract concept. It consists of particularities -
  particularities of persons and particularities of nations. We have to work for the welfare of man-
  kind through the service of the nations. We have to serve nations through the service of humanity.
  I should like to quote to you here two statements made by Gandhi. They are words of wisdom and
  words of warning. He says, “My idea of nationalism is that my country may become free” - mark
  the word - “that, if need be, the whole of my country may die so that the human race may live.
  There is no room for race hatred here”. Let that be our nationalism. We want independence for
  our country, to serve the welfare of humanity, and if the welfare of humanity cannot be served by
  our survival we shall vote for our non-survival. Again, “I want to think in terms of the whole world.
  My patriotism includes the good of mankind in general. My service of India includes the service of
  humanity. Isolated independence is not the goal of the world States. It is voluntary interdependence.
  The better mind of the world desires today not absolutely independent States warring one against
  another, but a federation of friendly, interdependent States. The consummation of that event may
  be far off. I want to make no grand claim for our country. But I see nothing extravagant or impos-
  sible about our expressing our readiness for universal interdependence rather than isolated inde-
  pendence. ” That is the view of Gandhi. He asks us to work for an interdependent world.
  (11) Those who serve in this Organization should be dedicated to the spirit of this interdependence,
  of this world union. There may be strong nationalists; they may have their particular political
  convictions, but all these should be subordinated to the one task of developing international cons-
  cience, That is the supreme loyalty which we expect from our international civil servants. It is
  not right for them to indulge in any activities which may lead to nationalist egotism or ideological
  hatreds, but we should remember that democratic institutions are not devised for bringing about
  uniformity of political opinion. The essential feature of democracy is that, under its auspices, many
  different types of life and character, thought and belief, can develop unmolested. We cannot destroy
  ideas by intimidation. They can be destroyed only if we provide something better in their place.

                                              Plenary Meetings                                           III-1
In our efforts to save democracy let us not empty it of its content. In this Organization our supreme
purpose should be to give a soul to this world, which is struggling to find its unity, not merely ma-
terially, economically and politically, but culturally and spiritually.
(12) If you study the rise and fall of civilizations you will develop a healthy scepticism about our
own civilization. We need not think that it is something permanent. We can make it permanent only
if we try to build it on moral foundations and not on foundations of collective selfishness.        What is
necessary is our primary patriotism to human welfare and the building up of this world on moral
and spiritual values. If we overlook this, our civilization will perish, and it does not deserve to
survive.
(13) All nations of the world stand today at a critical point. They are facing a test for human civi-
lization itself. Unless the Lord build the house, it cannot endure. Unless you are able to subordi-
nate your particular interests, unless you are able to put moral principle and international justice
higher than your national security and interest, this civilization will also pass into history. That is
the warning which history has for us. If the past has anything to teach us, it is this. We must try
to rethink our foundations and build our world on sounder bases.
(14) I have great pleasure in declaring this Second Extraordinary Session of the General Conference
open.
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE
(15) The first business is the establishment of the Credentials Committee. According to Rule of
Procedure 27, I propose the first nine members of the Credentials Committee at the Seventh
Session: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, India, United Kingdom. United States of America.
Venezuela and Yugoslavia.
(16) Article IV 8(b) of the Constitution makes the right to vote conditional upon the payment by
Member States of their financial contributions. Certain States whose contributions were in arrears
were advised of that fact by the Director-General in letters dated 13 March 1953, and a further
note on 5 June 1953. These States are Argentina, Bolivia, China, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala,
Hungary, Iran, Poland and Uruguay. They will be unable to vote during the General Conference
since the amount of their arrears exceeds the amount of contributions due from them for the current
year and the immediately preceding calendar year. Paragraph 8(c) of Article IV declares, however,
that the General Conference may permit such Member States to vote if it is satisfied that the failure
to pay is due to conditions beyond their control. It therefore rests with the delegations of the
countries concerned to request the General Conference, if they think fit, to adopt this latter course.
Requests should be addressed to the President of the Conference, who will transmit them to the
General Committee. Such a request has already been addressed to me by the Head of the Chinese
delegation and by the Head of the Uruguayan delegation.
   The General Conference adjourned until the Credentials Committee submitted its report.
 REPORT OF THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE
(17) The PRESIDENT - I call on the Chairman of the Credentials Committee.
(18) Mr. PARRA-PEREZ (Venezuela) (Chairman of the Credentials Committee) - (Translation from
the Spanish) Mr. President, fellow delegates, the Committee established by the General Conference
of Unesco at its Second Extraordinary Session met at eleven o’clock this morning, its members being
the representatives of the following countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, India, United
Kingdom, United States of America, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.
(19) This Committee did me the honour to elect me as its Chairman, and I am speaking on its
behalf. The Committee examined the credentials submitted to it by the Director-General of the
Organization from various Member States, and decided at this first meeting that the delegates of
the following States had been duly accredited in conformity with Rule 22 of the Rules of Procedure
of the General Conference by instruments issued either by the Head of the State, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, or another minister authorized for that purpose by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs
of their respective countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, German Federal Republic, Greece, Haiti,
India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Japan, Laos, Liberia, Libya, Mexico, Monaco, Norway, Panama,
Peru, Philippines, Saudi-Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Union of South Africa,
 United Kingdom, United States of America, Viet-Nam, Yugoslavia. The Committee recommends

  III- 1                                        Plenary       Meetings
  that the delegations of these Member States be allowed to take part in the Second Extraordinary Ses-
   sion of the General Conference.
  (20) In addition, credentials in the form of letters, telegrams or other documents issued either by
   some minister other than the Minister for Foreign Affairs and not authorized by him, or by heads
   of diplomatic missions, or by senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been submitted
  by the representatives of the following States: Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Egypt,
   Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Korea, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua,
   Pakistan, Syria, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela.
   (21) The Committee suggests that the documents thus received be deemed to constitute provisional
   credentials for the representatives of the aforesaid countries, it being understood that the delega-
   tions concerned will be required later to present credentials in due form, and that meanwhile they
   shall be admitted to participation in the work of the Second Extraordinary Session of the General
   Conference.
   (22) The following Member States have submitted no credentials and were not represented at this
   morning’s meeting: Afghanistan, Argentina, Bolivia, Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, Hungary,
   Nepal, Poland, Union of Burma.
   (23) In order to save time, the Committee suggests that if further credentials are submitted to it,
   they shall be examined by the Chairman, who will report thereon to the General Conference.
   (24) The PRESIDENT - Do any delegates wish to speak on this report?                  May I take it that the report
   has the approval of the Conference? The report is approved.
   ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
   (25) The PRESIDENT - I call upon the Chairman of the Executive Board.
   (26) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) (Chairman of the Executive Board) - Mr. President and
   fellow delegates, I have the honour on behalf of the Executive Board to propose to the General Con-
   ference the adoption of its agenda. This agenda is in front of you in document 2 XC/ 1, with one
   addition which I will mention later. You will see that, after the purely formal items necessary for
   the organization of the session, which are items 1 to 6, there follow the three items which the
   General Conference at its Seventh Session decided to place on the agenda of the Extraordinary Ses-
   sion. These are item 7 - Appointment of the Director-General; item 8 - Plans for the Headquarters
   building and item 9 - Resignation of Mr. Ribnikar of Yugoslavia from the Executive Board.
   (27) After these items, decided on by the Conference itself, there are four further items which the
    Executive Board recommends to the Conference: item 10 - Report by the Acting Director-General
   on the work of the Organization during the time that he has been in charge; item 11 - Communica-
   tions from the Governments of Hungary and Czechoslovakia; and items 12 and 13 - Two urgent and
    important questions concerning the staff.
    (28) Finally, the Government of India has requested that the Conference should place on its agenda
   the following item: “Consideration of the report of the seminar on the contribution of Gandhian
   outlook and techniques to the solution of tensions among and within nations”. The Executive Board
    considers this question to be of great importance and it has therefore recommended to the Confer-
    ence to include it on its agenda. Consequently, the Executive Board recommends to the Conference
   the adoption of the agenda consisting of these fourteen items.
    (29) The PRESIDENT - There is a request from the Government of the United States of America
    for the inclusion of a supplementary item in the provisional agenda. I call upon the Head of the
    United States delegation.
    (30) Mr. SALOMON (United States of America) - Mr. President, fellow delegates, the United States
    delegation has requested the inclusion of an item on the agenda of the Conference, which is described
    in document 2 XC/l0 dated 25 June 1953. The purpose of the supplementary agenda item is to pro-
    vide an opportunity for the review of certain aspects of Unesco personnel policy, with a view to
    achieving conformity with United Nations policy in this matter. I hope that this item will be included
    in the agenda.
    (31) The PRESIDENT - The Conference has before it the agenda of fourteen items presented by the
    Chairman of the Executive Board and an additional item presented by the United States delegation.
    Any observations? Those in favour of the adoption of this agenda of 15 items, 14 by the Chairman
    of the Executive Board and one by the leader of the United States delegation ? Those against? The agenda
    is adopted unanimously.

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE
(32) I call upon the Chairman of the Executive Board.
(33) Sir Ronald ADAM (Chairman of the Executive Board) - In accordance with Rule 30 of the
Rules of Procedure, the Executive Board is required to provide the Conference with information to
assist it in preparing the list of nominations to the posts of President and Vice-Presidents of the
Conference. The Board has discussed this question of nominations and has come to the conclusion
that the most satisfactory course for the Extraordinary Conference would be to re-elect “en bloc”
all the officers who constituted the General Committee at the Seventh Session. In so doing the Con-
ference will save a great deal of time and it will be assured of having a satisfactory geographical
distribution of the seats on the General Committee. Moreover, it will be following the precedent
created at the First Extraordinary Session in 1948, when all the officers of the Second Session were
reappointed. The Board, therefore, recommends to the Conference that it should elect the officers
of the Seventh Session who made up the General Committee. These officers were: President:
Head of the delegation of India; Vice-Presidents: Heads of the delegations of the German Federal
Republic, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Liberia, Mexico, Pakistan, United Kingdom and Syria.
(34) It also suggests a member of the delegation of Lebanon for the Programme Commission; a
member of the delegation of the United States of America for the Administrative Commission; a
member of the delegation of Venezuela for the Credentials Committee; a member of the delegation
of the Netherlands for the Nominations Committee; a member of the delegation of Sweden for the
Budget Committee; a member of the delegation of Japan for the Legal Committee; and a member
of the delegation of Turkey for the Committee on Reports of Member States.
(35) It would be understood that, although the Chairman of the various Commissions and Commit-
tees would be re-elected and would sit on the General Committee, their Commissions and Commit-
tees would only be called together to meet if the Conference deemed it necessary.
(36) The PRESIDENT - Any observations.? May I take it that the recommendations of the Chairman
of the Executive Board have the approval of the Conference.? The membership of the General Com-
mittee will thus be as follows: India, Canada, France, German Federal Republic, Greece, Italy,
 Liberia, Mexico, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Syria, Lebanon, United States of America, Venezuela,
Netherlands, Sweden, Japan and Turkey.
(37) Will these delegations give the names of the delegates who will be required to serve on the
General Committee? Canada, H. E. Mr. Pierre Dupuy; France, H. E. Mr. Andre Marie; German
 Federal Republic, Mr. Rudolf Salat; Greece, Professor Alexandre Photiades; Italy, H. E. Dr.
 Bartolomeo Migone; Liberia, Honourable Nathaniel V. Massaquoi; Mexico, H. E. Don Francisco
A. de Icaza; Pakistan, Mr. Hussain; United Kingdom, Sir Ben Bowen Thomas; Syria, Dr.
Constantin Zurayk; Lebanon, Mgr Jean Maroun; United States of America, Mr. Irving Salomon;
Venezuela, H. E. Dr. C. Parra-Perez; Netherlands, Dr. F. Bender; Sweden, Professor Ingemar
During; Japan, H. E. Mr. Toru Haguiwara; Turkey, Professor Bedrettin Tuncel.
 ADMISSION OF OBSERVERS FROM INTERNATIONAL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS
 (38) The PRESIDENT - I call upon the Chairman of the Executive Board.
 (39) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) (Chairman of the Executive Board) - The recommendations
 of the Executive Board on this point are set out in document 2 XC/4. In addition to the 106 non-
 governmental organizations who have consultative arrangements with Unesco and who have been
 invited to send observers to the present session, the Executive Board recommends to the Confer-
 ence that it should invite, in accordance with Rule of Procedure 7, the three following organizations
 to be represented by observers: Carnegie Foundation for International Peace; Rockefeller Found-
 ation and the Ford Foundation. The activities of these organizations and their interest in Unesco are
 well known and they have been invited to attend previous sessions of the Conference.
 (40) The PRESIDENT - Have these recommendations the approval of the Conference ? Mr. Parra-
 Perez has an additional statement to make.
 (41) Mr. PARRA-PEREZ (Venezuela) (Chairman of the Credentials Committee) - (Translation
 from the Spanish) The Credentials Committee, at its meeting this morning, also examined the
 credentials of observers from the following States, which are not Members of the Organization:
 Finland, Ireland, Holy See; and those of observers representing the United Nations, the International
                                                      - 33 -

     RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE REGARDING THE RIGHT OF CERTAIN DELEGATIONS TO VOTE
     (1) The PRESIDENT - The General Committee studied the requests received from the delegations
     of China, Iran and Uruguay, and decided to recommend to the General Conference to grant the right
     to vote at the present Extraordinary Session to these three Member States, in accordance with the
     provisions of Article IV 8(c) of the Constitution. The General Committee recommends, moreover,
     that the same facilities be granted for these Extraordinary Sessions to any other Member State that
     presents its credentials in due form, that has fully paid its contributions up to 1950 inclusive, and
     that submits a request to be allowed to vote to the President of the Conference. The recommenda-
     tions are approved.
     REPORT OF THE ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ORGANIZATION FROM NOVEMBER 1952
     TO APRIL 1953
     (2) The PRESIDENT - We now proceed to the discussion of the report of the Acting Director-Gene-
     ral. The Chairman of the Executive Board will present the report.
      (3) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) (Chairman of the Executive Board) - Mr. President, fellow
     delegates, under Article V. 9 of the Constitution the Chairman of the Executive Board presents the
     report of the Director-General with or without comments to every ordinary session of the General
     Conference. Nothing is said about extraordinary sessions. Now, the members of the Executive
      Board felt that this was an occassion in which the Acting Director-General had carried on for a con-
      siderable period and that it was right that he should give a report of his work to this Extraordinary
      Session. It is a report of the work carried out since Dr. Torres Bodet reported to the Seventh Ses-
      sion up to October 1952. and the report, as you see, carries us up to the end of April 1953. Norm-
      ally this report involves a long discussion, because it introduces the new programme of thefollowing
                                                              - 34 -

two years. In this case the programme for this year and next year was decided at the last session,
and the Executive Board therefore decided that I should present this report without comments and
suggest that the discussion of it should not be unduly prolonged. The Board, however, commends
this report to your notice as it contains accounts of many important activities and is, for the past
four months, a record of the achievements of the Organization under the Acting Director-General of
which he can be proud. With these few words I would present the report to you.
(4) The PRESIDENT - I now call on the Acting Director-General.
(5) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the report submit-
ted to you does not call for a long speech of introduction. You will, however, perhaps allow me to
offer a few remarks that could not be included in a simple, impersonal record of activities.
(6) In my capacity as a temporary executive, I could not contemplate anything beyond preserving the
“status quo”, and that has, indeed, been my main purpose. If I may be allowed to borrow a famous
device, I should say that during these months, in which difficulties have not been lacking, my domi-
nating thought might be summed up in the words “Je maintiendrai - I will maintain”. To maintain
the efficiency and the dignity of Unesco at the level to which they were brought by the efforts of that
incomparable administrator, Mr. Torres Bodet, to whom I should like to pay here my tribute of
respect and loyalty: I wanted no more than that.
(7) As regards efficiency, the detailed report submitted to you records results of many kinds which
you will no doubt want to consider. I shall cite only a few examples.
(8) Aid to intellectual co-operation, both as regards collaboration between specialists and the org-
anization of documentation, has continued to develop most satisfactorily in the fields of science and
culture. There is no question but that this activity represents a permanent function of Unesco and
enables it to render very useful service.
(9) The appeal for fundamental education, so nobly voiced by my predecessor, has given rise to
increasingly important efforts in Member States. The idea is gaining ground, and nothing now will
be able to stop it. Unesco is doing its best to help Member States in this enormous task. After the
Centre established two years ago at Patzcuaro in Mexico, for Latin America, a second Training
Centre was opened in January at Sirs-el-Layyan, Egypt, for the Arab States, and concurrently
various experiments are being successfully continued in different parts of the world with stimulating
results: for instance, at Marbial in Haiti, at Minneryia in Ceylon, at Dujeilah in Iraq, and at Klay
in Liberia.
(10) At the Conference held in Bombay last December and attended by delegates from fifteen States
of South and South-East Asia and the Pacific, Unesco made an effort to give regional significance to
the campaign for the progressive application of the principle of free and compulsory schooling
launched in 1951 at the Fourteenth Conference on Public Education. The Bombay Conference fully
realized its double aim, which was confined to a survey of the problems and a statement of proposed
solutions. Now words must be translated into acts if high hopes are not once more to be bitterly
disappointed. This places upon international solidarity a definite responsibility, which the General
Conference should recognize here and now.
(11) We have also been active in assisting refugees from Palestine in the Middle East, and our aid
has been more substantial than before, thanks to the considerably larger funds which, at our sug-
gestion, the United Nations Relief Rehabilitation Administration has devoted to education.
(12) In a field that has always occupied an important place in the programme of the Organization
for the application of the Social Sciences to the solution of contemporary problems, special mention
should be made of the seminar which the Indian National Commission organized at Delhi in January
on the contribution of the ideas and methods of Gandhi to the elimination of national and international
tensions. This seminar aroused very wide interest, and the General Conference will certainly study
the report that the Indian delegation has submitted on this subject.
(13) Finally, to end this rapid review, I am pleased to be able to inform you that, after eighteen
months of negotiation and careful study, in which the Secretariat has been closely associated, the
European Council for Nuclear Research, set up in December 1951 under the auspices of Unesco,
and composed of twelve European Member States of the Organization, adopted yesterday, at the last
meeting it held in Unesco House, a Convention for the establishment of a permanent regional body.
This organization, whose headquarters will be at Geneva, will have at its disposal for the carrying
out of an international programme of research, a laboratory equipped with more powerful apparatus
than has existed till now. This enterprising effort of regional co-operation is financed by a budget
equivalent to $28, 000, 000, which the States taking part in it undertake to pay in seven years. This
is an enterprise without precedent in European history and it may have a decisive influence on
scientific thought in that old continent. I salute it, both as a promise and as an example, and a
welcome event in Unesco’s work for peace and progress.

    III-2                                        Plenary Meetings
     (14) In calling your attention to these happy results, I do not want to conceal from you the less
     satisfactory items in the seven months’ balance-sheet. Some of our difficulties are political, like
    those still hindering the realization of certain plans of a regional character. But the main obstacle
    to the full effectiveness of our efforts remains the meagreness of our resources. Despite the most
    rigorous measures of economy, it is already clear that the budget is adequate to ensure only a mi-
    nimum of activities - considerably less than we are technically able to undertake, and certainly less
    than the machinery of the Organization and its responsibilities warrant. In many cases, for instance
    as regards our research programme for the Arid Zone, our Science Co-operation Offices or our
    action through Press, Radio, Cinema, Television, and by means of Exhibitions, a small increase
    in the funds available would produce much better results. In a general sense, it seems to me that
    budgetary restrictions have reached the limit at which the return, that is to say, the proportion
    between the irreducible expenditure and useful results, is perilously diminished.
     (15) The hopes entertained by the General Conference of acquiring supplementary resources outside
    the budget have not materialized. The Technical Assistance Fund, far from increasing, has been
    stabilized at a level which has already necessitated a severe limitation of our activities.         Unesco’s
    share in this Fund, which stood at $3, 697,000 in 1952, was fixed at $3, 231,000 for 1953, whereas,
    at the last session of the General Conference a figure of $5,000,000 was mentioned. This reduc-
    tion has obliged us not only to forgo the consideration of many new requests, but has also put an end
    prematurely to certain current projects. There again, the services of the Organization fail, through
    lack of funds, to answer the expectations of Member States.
    (16) As regards private voluntary contributions for the financing of certain activities, such as
    fundamental education training centres and Unesco’s Institutes in Germany, all our efforts to secure
    assistance from foundations likely to be interested have so far been fruitless. In this connexion, I
    should like to draw your attention to document 2 XC/5 Addendum, containing a letter recently ad-
    dressed to me by the Chairman of the International Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History
    of Mankind, concerning the very difficult situation in which the Commission is now placed because
    it can no longer rely on the hope of external financial assistance.
    (17) I sincerely hope that the financial restrictions at present impeding the development of the
    Organization are only temporary, and that at your next session the international situation will have
    improved sufficiently to enable Member States to grant Unesco resources more in keeping with its
    capacities.
    (18) Here, I think, much will depend upon the Secretariat, whose ability and devotion are, in
    present circumstances, particularly important.
    (19) I am glad to be able to give you on this point all the assurances you could wish. A period under
    a temporary Director is a severe test for a young administration. I can assure you that the Secre-
    tariat has come through this test in a way that does it credit. Whether it is a question of my senior
    colleagues - an excellent team formed by my predecessor, which has kept together and not lost
    faith - or of the Secretariat as a whole, all, from the humblest employee to the highest official,
    have continued to serve the Organization with a loyalty and devotion to which I pay tribute. I should
    like to express to each one of them my thanks and my esteem.
    (20) The importance of the part played by the Secretariat will no doubt justifiy, in your view, the
    special attention I have paid throughout these last months to the problems raised by the application
    to American citizens employed or about to be employed by Unesco, of the Executive Order of the
    President of the United States of America, dated 9 January and revised 2 June 1953.
    (21) I shall not dwell upon these problems here, since I have given you my views in document 2 XC/7
    already before you. I wish now only to emphasize one or two points made therein, and I quote:
      “The attitude taken by the Acting Director-General has been essentially determined by his concern
       to maintain the two basic principles according to which the Secretariat is actually organized, and
       which are set out in Article VI, paragraph 5 of the Constitution and in Regulations 1.1 and 1.4 of
       the Staff Regulations.
       Article VI, paragraph 5 of the Constitution secures the international and independent character of
       the staff in discharging their functions. It provides that:
      ‘The responsibilities of the Director-General and of the staff shall be exclusively international in
        character. In the discharge of their duties they shall not seek or receive instructions from any
        government or from any authority external to the Organization. They shall refrain from anyaction
       which might prejudice their position as international officials. Each State Member of the Orga-
       nization undertakes to respect the international character of the responsibilities of the Director-
       General and the staff, and not to seek to influence them in the discharge of their duties. I”
    (22) On certain aspects of the matter, the existing Staff Regulations provide clear guidance.
    (23) Staff Regulation 1.4 states that members of the Secretariat - and here I quote - ” . . . should
    not be expected to give up religious or political convictions or national sentiment . . . ” It therefore
    follows that staff members’ political and regilious convictions and national sentiments are not,
                                                           - 36 -

                                              Plenary      Meetings                                     III- 2
“per se”, matters with which the Organization is concerned.
(24) Staff Regulation 1.4 also provides that “members of the Secretariat shall conduct themselves
at all times in a manner consonant with the good repute and high purposes of the Organization and
their status as international civil servants. They shall not engage in any activity that is incompati-
ble with the proper discharge of their duties. They shall avoid any action and in particular any kind
of public pronouncement which would adversely reflect on their position as international officials.. .
they shall at all times exercise the reserve and tact incumbent upon them by reason of their inter-
national responsibilities. ”
(25) Staff Regulation 1.1 provides that members of the Secretariat, by accepting appointment, un-
dertake to discharge their functions and to regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organiza-
tion only in view.
(26) These Staff Regulations make it clear that staff members must scrupulously avoid any active
political engagement. The Organization is not concerned with the orientation of staff members’
political activities: staff members are liable to disciplinary action for any active participation in a
political undertaking, no matter of what kind.
(27) Lastly, there is another question about which I should like to say a few words before I conclude,
because it is an important question and one to which I have given my special attention. I mean the
building of the new permanent headquarters. Unesco has had its headquarters in Paris for seven
years now, and here it found from the beginning the right atmosphere for its work. But it is natural
and necessary that the Organization should have, as soon as possible, a house to call its own. The
problem is twofold: first, the building must be adequate to the requirements of the universal mis-
sion of Unesco; and secondly, it must harmonize with the architecture and with the historical setting
of a city that is itself a work of art, with its own atmosphere. In short, Unesco must feel at home
in Paris, and Paris for its part must be able to welcome Unesco “comme quelqu’un de la famille”,
as one of the family.
(28) I am convinced that the new plans submitted to you by the Headquarters Committee, plans that
have been drawn up by eminent architects who have had the benefit of the best possible advice, in-
geniously satisfy this double requirement, within reasonable budgetary limits. The very generous
conditions agreed by the French Government, both as regards the ground lease and the granting of
a long-term, interest-free loan for the building and the equipment should enable the plans to be ac-
cepted without hesitation, so that work can begin in January 1954.
(29) The attentive studies and complicated negotiations attendant upon this scheme have given me a
fresh opportunity of appreciating the active interest the French authorities continue to take inunes-
co. The relations of an international organization with the host country are of particular importance,
both in respect of the Organization’s practical working conditions and the psychological atmosphere
that surrounds it. Unesco’s relations with France are marked by the most cordial sympathy.                  It
gives me great satisfaction to record this, and I should like to express my most sincere thanks to
my French friends for their constant consideration and for the support they have always given me
in the fulfilment of my task.
(30) Such, it seems to me, are the salient facts of the period that has elapsed since you did me the
honour of appointing me Acting Director-General. I have endeavoured to carry out conscientiously
and to the best of my ability the duties of a post I did not seek. I accepted the post out of respect
for your wishes and from loyalty to the Organization. In the same spirit I restore it today to your
keeping.
 DISCUSSION ON THE REPORT OF THE ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL
 (31) The PRESIDENT - The Chairman of the Executive Board already said that a full discussion
usually takes place in normal sessions, but we have read the report and heard the remarks. Any
observations delegates wish to make are quite welcome.
(32) Mr. PIAGET (Switzerland) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, I shall be very
brief. The Swiss delegation is, however, anxious to intervene in the discussion because it considers
that Unesco owes a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Taylor. The Acting Director-General began his
work at a very difficult moment; the unexpected departure of a distinguished chief produced for a
time at Unesco House a certain demoralization in the Secretariat, and all Unesco’s friends outside
were extremely disturbed. Mr. Taylor also encountered additional difficulties in the discharge of
his duties; the question of the status of the officials must have given rise to real problems of con-
science. The Board took a decision on the subject which seems to me to be grave and which is a
gloomy page in its history: it was a decision which, to say the least, has left a sense of uneasiness
in our minds. The Acting Director-General surmounted all these difficulties with courage and ef-
ficiency. At first, he spoke little and at Board meetings seemed to take no active initiative; but
                                                       - 37 -

      we very soon learnt that this was not really the case and that he was playing a constructive part in
      working out the programme. He evinced keen loyalty to the Secretariat and to the Board; in a word
       he did not behave like an Acting but like a permanent Director-General. He has maintained the
       Torres Bodet tradition, and the report which he has presented to us is truly impressive in view of
      the short period it covers. We want to thank him and congratulate him most warmly; the whole
      Secretariat has lived up to its traditions and deserves our unanimous gratitude; the Acting Director-
      General has done his work like a real Director.
      (33) The PRESIDENT - I call upon Mr. Verniers, Belgium.
      (34) Mr. VERNIERS (Belgium) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, in coming to Paris
      I had no intention of speaking on the report which the Deputy Director-General was to present, but
      when I heard my friend Mr. Piaget praising the Acting Director-General, I thought I should also
      express my views. I feel it a duty, a duty dictated by conscience, to say, first, how much the re-
      signation of the Director-General, Mr. Torres Bodet, has affected all those who, like myself, have
      faith in Unesco. My thoughts turn at this moment to the Director-General who resigned. I propose
      - and I hope you will pardon this personal confidence - to write to him this very day to tell him that,
      in the difficult circumstances in which his friends are placed, they do not forget him.
      (35) May I now turn to you, Mr. Acting Director-General, and associate myself most cordially and
      affectionately with the praise addressed to you by my friend Mr. Piaget? You have borne yourself
      as a real Director-General during this exceptionally difficult period, and you have acted energetic-
      ally and loyally in regard to the institution and the members of its staff. I also wish, as Mr. Piaget
      and you yourself have done, to congratulate on behalf of the Belgian Delegation all the members of
     the Secretariat, for they too have behaved as good servants of Unesco. Without their ready, loyal
      collaboration day in day out, you would have been unable to steer the ship as you have done.
      (36) Among the activities which do credit to Unesco and which make me believe, despite the tem-
      porary difficulties which confront it, that it has a great destiny, I shall mention, as you yourself
      have done, the accomplishment of two practical tasks which are striking testimony to the spirit of
      international collaboration - the setting up of the International Computation Centre and the signature,
      due to take place almost immediately at the Quai d’Orsay, of the Convention establishing a European
     Nuclear Research Laboratory, destined solely to serve the cause of science and peace.
      (37) I should like to take this opportunity of giving the delegations here a word of advice. You will
     observe that it is directly connected with the item on the agenda that we have now reached. As
     those of you who have been here before will remember, I have always been a warm supporter of
     one of Unesco’s methods of work. Formerly, known as the seminar, it is now called in French
     the “stage d’études”. I shall begin to entertain some doubts regarding the efficacy of these semi-
     nars unless the governments take more account of the value of Unesco’s ideals on the higher plane.
     By that I mean it is not sufficient for governments to send representatives to seminars: worthy
     representatives must be chosen. A government must not, for considerations of convenience or eco-
     nomy, select for a course some holder of a fellowship who happens to be travelling or staying in the
     country where the seminar is held, nor call upon the cultural attache or some other member of the
     Diplomatic Corps in the host country. I have the greatest respect for diplomats, but they will agree
     with me that they are not qualified in every technical subject dealt with at international seminars.
     I have received documentation from the Secretariat regarding work I shall have to do in the near
     future on an expert committee which will deal with the principles and methods relating to the pro-
     motion of international citizenship. It comprises reports prepared at the course held last year at
     Woudschoten (Netherlands). I do not want to disparage the work done there or to indulge in a
     personal attack on any particular participant. I must, however, tell you with my habitual frankness
     that the reports will not be specially brilliant. I may say they are rather poor in quality. On
     making enquiries I found that, as the result of a custom which I strongly deprecate, a very consi-
     derable proportion of the persons attending the course were completely unqualified. It is not a mat-
     ter of coming to spend five or six weeks in a foreign country and making pleasant trips and excur-
     sions while there. Certainly one always benefits by meeting foreigners, and travel educates the
     young. But seminars organized at great cost by Unesco should undoubtedly produce other results
     as well. I therefore take this opportunity of calling upon all those present to make an urgent appeal
     to their Governments to select qualified representatives as occasion arises, so that the results of
     the seminars may be as fruitful, as positive and as constructive as possible.
     (38) I will end as I began by expressing my thanks and also my confidence in the future of Unesco.
     The easing in the world political situation to which our eminent President referred this morning in
     his admirable speech, permits us to hope that the financial burden of armaments may be less heavy
     in the future, and that we may see correspondingly larger sums available for the works of peace,
     and in particular for those sponsored by Unesco. I have therefore the hope that at Montevideo in
                                                             - 38 -

1954 we may perhaps consider the possibility of an increased budget and an expanded programme.
(39) Mr. MARIE (France) - (Translation from the French) I mount this rostrum to fulfil an ele-
mentary duty on behalf of my country’s delegation - the elementary but entirely pleasurable duty of
expressing its thanks. My duty consists in coming here to tell the Acting Director-General, Mr.
Taylor, with what gratitude and pleasure we have heard the words of thanks he has been good
enough to express to France in his notable report. He has pointed out - and we have found this
most touching - the pleasure and pride with which we have welcomed the work of the Director-Gen-
eral, in the same way that we welcome with pleasure and gratitude the big international conferences
which Unesco holds in our capital. But I should like to tell him that he has really been too kind in
reversing the direction in which thanks should naturally be given. It is France that owes him a
debt of gratitude - as the distinguished Swiss delegate, Mr. Piaget, has so well said, and as Mr.
Verniers, on behalf of Belgium, has also said - for having uplifted and held aloft the torch in the
difficult circumstances in which he was good enough to take it over. For that reason, and that
alone, I have mounted this rostrum. It gives me the greatest pleasure to express here our delight
in the uninterrupted, cordial and efficient collaboration we have enjoyed with a Director-General
who, acting in a temporary capacity, has to say the least, shown himself exceptionally worthy of
the high office which he assumed in the difficult circumstances just referred to. France is proud,
ladies and gentlemen - as I believe I shall have the opportunity to repeat tomorrow or the next day -
to welcome your international Organization to her capital. She will do, she has already done, she
will continue to do, everything possible to provide this international Organization with headquarters
befitting its work and with the conditions and comfort it requires. But let me tell you at once how
delighted we are, in common with Mr. Taylor and the speakers who preceded me, to be able to record
at the Quai d’Orsay this very afternoon the fulfilment of one of the greatest hopes we have been
cherishing of late years. If I am not mistaken, it was in 1951 that a European Council, under
Unesco’s auspices, began the work of framing the Nuclear Research Centre Convention, which is to
be signed in a few hours in the Salon de l’Horloge in our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We are ex-
tremely happy to know that in a few moments the representatives of Belgium, Denmark, France,
the German Federal Republic, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom and Yugoslavia will sign this Convention, conferring upon the European Nuclear
Research Centre a definite status. We are convinced that the International Laboratory in Geneva,
designed for research on high energy particles and cosmic rays, will be a great force in the devel-
opment of international co-operation in the field of nuclear research, and it is on this note of hope
- the hope of seeing Unesco, through international co-operation, working for peace with new effect-
iveness - that I wish to repeat to the Acting Director-General our feelings of gratitude and affection.
(40) Mr. MALIK (India) - I would like, on behalf of the Indian delegation, to pay a tribute to the
work of the Acting Director-General, Mr. Taylor. Living as I do in Paris, and having had the op-
portunity of working with him both on the Executive Board and on the Headquarters Committee during
these last few months, I have had many opportunities of seeing the work that Mr. Taylor has been
doing. He has said very modestly that, when he assumed this great responsibility, he had set
before him the idea “Je maintiendrai”. Well, 1 think he has done more than that. His devotion to
the high purposes and the great ideas of this world Organization have been very obvious. He refer-
red to the loyalty of his staff. It was generous of him, but we must remember that loyalty and de-
votion are also very often inspired by the personality of the man who has the privilege of directing
that staff, and I think that no one has been able to see better than we have here in Paris the mutual
devotion there has been between the Acting Director-General and his staff. I would like to say then,
in conclusion, that the work of Unesco during these few months - and they have been months follow-
ing a great crisis when there were all kinds of dangerous possibilities for Unesco itself - has been
well handled by Dr. Taylor, and the thanks of this Organization are due to him for his devotion to the
ideals and the interests of Unesco.
(41) Mr. LAVES (United States of America) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, the Head of the
United States delegation has done me the honour of asking me personally to deliver these few com-
ments on the report of the Acting Director-General, in view of the fact that I have the good fortune
of being the Chairman of the United States National Commission for Unesco, and that that Commis-
sion carries special responsibilities in the United States for helping the American people to co-
operate effectively in the work of Unesco. We have direct knowledge of the work that is being done
by the Organization, and it seemed therefore peculiarly appropriate that a representative of the
Commission should make comments that relate primarily to the programme.
(42) In this General Conference, so largely devoted to the selection of a Director-General for
Unesco, the United States delegation is happy that this item on the agenda - the report of the Acting
                                                       - 39 -

  III-2                                        Plenary        Meetings
  Director-General - gives us a natural opportunity to commend the leadership of our fellow American,
  John W. Taylor, who has served as the Acting Director-General over the past seven months. The
  care, the judgment, the courage, the warm humanity which he has brought to bear upon Unesco’s
  efforts during this vexing and difficult period have evoked in us both gratitude and pride. Many del-
  egates left the Conference last December in a mood of great anxiety. The resignation of a highly
  respected, able and sincere leader of an Organization has often resulted in such a severe loss of
  morale among the group of civil servants responsible to him for its daily work that its enterprises
  have faltered. The possibility of this happening in Unesco last fall was augmented by the temporary
  character of the assignment given to the Acting Director-General and by the growing financial strin-
  gency facing the Organization. The situation constituted a severe test of the maturity and the pro-
  fessional competence of all the members of the Secretariat. This report, as well as the one sub-
  mitted earlier to the Executive Board, are strong evidence that the essential work of the Organiza-
  tion has indeed gone forward. The carrying-out of the activity authorized by the resolutions in
  December has been pursued faithfully, expeditiously and with some notable advance. This success-
  ful surmounting of obstacles, both psychological and substantial, warrant our sincere commenda-
  tion of the Secretariat and of the Acting Director-General.
  (43) Permit me to note a very few of the items referred to in this report which have seemed to US
  of particular importance in this particular year. We have been especially gratified that the second
  Centre for the training of teachers of Fundamental Education is now under way, and that the first
  group of teachers is, in fact, in training in the Middle East Centre. In our view, this work of
  Unesco in the field of fundamental education represents one of the most important programmes of
  the Organization and one which probably should make a greater call on its resources than any other
  portion of our programme.
  (44) We are equally gratified that the Bombay Conference, following the Fourteenth International
  Conference on Free and Compulsory Education, has stimulated, in the countries of South-East Asia,
  very practical action. That plans have indeed been advanced to establish a European Centre for
  Nuclear Research, devoted to co-operation for peaceful ends, is a happy illustration of Unesco-
  stimulated international co-operation in a most important intellectual field. We are impressed with
  the rapidly growing usefulness of the Field Science Co-operation Offices, and we have noted with
  particular pleasure the increasing demand being made on these Offices in the sphere of the social
  sciences.
  (45) Noting the report of the additional signatures to the Universal Copyright Convention - another
  example of the constructive and practical work done by this Organization, young as it is - I should
  like to say that in the United States this Convention has now been submitted by the President to the
  Senate and that the implementing legislation is expected shortly. In general, it seems to us, Mr.
  President, that the activities of the Organization are particularly encouraging in the fields of edu-
  cation and of science. To some extent, the same may be said of the resolutions and the progress
  made in the field of the social sciences and cultural activities. We, particularly the National Com-
  mission, feel some disappointment, perhaps because of the mounting insistence of world events,
  in the progress that has been made in regard to those varied activities which contribute to the edu-
  cation of persons in understanding and in strengthening the bond of international co-operation, to
  which the distinguished delegate of Belgium has only recently referred. This will no doubt be re-
   medied somewhat by the meetings of the expert committee called to meet here in Paris in mid-July
  to discuss the problem of Education for Living in a World Community. In this connexion, I think I
  should reassure you concerning the work of the United States National Commission. We are holding
  a conference this coming September in the city of Minneapolis for the precise purpose of discussing
  America’s stake in international co-operation. Our National Commission feels keenly the import-
  ance of public discussions on this problem, and we hope that any of you, or representatives of your
  National Commissions who may find themselves in the States in the course of the month of Septem-
  ber, will do us the honour of being present during these deliberations.
   (46) In commenting upon the report of the working party on future programme and development, we
  indicated earlier this year our concern that there should be greater concentration and more effective
  action on a more limited series of activities. We are fully aware that no one country has the right
  to assume that Unesco will concentrate only upon those things which are of particular interest to it,
  but we are equally convinced that all National Commissions would welcome an opportunity to concen-
  trate their efforts more and more, in order to be able more noticeably to influence the course of
   events and see the results of the work upon which they are engaged. I am sure all National Com-
   missions are faced by the same financial stringency which the American National Commission faces,
  and in these circumstances it is particularly important that we be not overburdened as National Com-
   missions with programmes which we cannot carry out, but to which we must give attention, and thus
  fritter away the small resources that are available.
   (47) I shall mention one last point. The United States delegation has noted particularly the portion
                                                          - 40 -

                                              Plenary       Meetings                                     III-2
of the Acting Director-General’s report dealing with National Commissions. We share his concern
over the slow rate at which evidence of strong National Commission work comes to the Secretariat.
We fear that this is evidence that ways and means for strengthening the work of National Commis-
sions are not being found as rapidly as the importance of Unesco’s task requires. We, like other
Member States, shall want to consider these issues when drawing up the programme for 1955-56.
(48) Meantime, and in conclusion, to the Acting Director-General and to the Secretariat the United
States Government, through its delegation here, extends our appreciation for the constructive work
that has been covered and been revealed in the Acting Director-General’s report. At no time since
Unesco was created has there been more evidence on every hand of the need for developing honest
understanding among peace-loving peoples. Nor has there ever been so much evidence of the im-
portance of Unesco in furthering that understanding which must underlie the work and the community
of the peoples joined in the United Nations.
(49) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, fellow delegates and
Mr. Acting Director-General, the countries and Governments most distant from Unesco Headquarters
have not remained indifferent to the tasks which you, Mr. Taylor, have accomplished during these
six months of arduous work. A castle in Spain was built and completed by the statesman and man of
genius who was our Director-General for some years. One evening this castle collapsed. You
were skilful and courageous enough to retrieve part after part and use what could still be used of
the former dream which had become a ruin, so as to begin again and to set out afresh. Such an act
of faith and devotion is not easily forgotten. Many men would have gone away dispirited after that
evening of which we still retain the bitter and unhappy memory. You remained, however, faithful
at your post; you stood by your old colleagues who had already shown proof of their courage, their
intelligence and their understanding of an arduous task. We are grateful to you, we who receive
from Unesco the vast benefits it has been called upon to distribute, demanding nothing but that we
should be its servants. Let me tell you that the experiment you have carried out during the last six
months is an experiment which is in itself of great value for the immediate future of Unesco. A
very great task was entrusted to you, to be fulfilled as you have pointed out with your characteristic
candour and boldness, with a budget inadequate for the purpose. We have before us a report cover-
ing six months’ work - six months during which everyone has given of his best. But the work, as
you have been the first to realize, falls far below that which this same machine, inspired by a man
of courage, intelligence and goodwill, could have produced if he had been given the funds he needed.
(50) Technical Assistance is one of the stumbling-blocks of this Organization. We were led to hope,
I am sure in all good faith, that a reduction in Unesco’s budget would be followed by an increase in
the Technical Assistance budget. You also pointed this out in your report. The contrary has
occurred, and the reduction in the Technical Assistance budget has perhaps been even larger than
the reduction in the Unesco budget. One reduction has followed another. Yet, at a time when the
funds for our work were being constantly cut, you have nevertheless shown that, regardless of
financial resources and in spite of every possible restriction, the dignity of a man bent on his task
can make a worthy effort, and this effort you have accomplished. I earnestly hope you will be able to
continue your work.
(51) The PRESIDENT - I feel sure I am echoing the sentiments of all the delegates present here
when I congratulate the Acting Director-General on the manner in which he has discharged the duties
which were suddengly imposed on him, and on the courage and ability, the modesty and humanity
which governed his administration.
 APPOINTMENT OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL ON THE PROPOSALOF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
(52) The PRESIDENT - We now proceed to the next item on the agenda: the appointment of the
Director-General. This meeting will be a private session in accordance with Rules 62, 64, 65 and
67 of the Rules of Procedure. The following persons may attend the private plenary meeting for the
election of the Director-General: (1) members of delegations entitled to vote; (2) delegates of
Member States not entitled to vote; (3) observers of non-Member States; (4) members of the Exe-
cutive Board who are not members of delegations; (5) representatives of the United Nations; (6)
the minimum Secretariat staff required.
    The meeting went into private session.

   III-2                                        Plenary Meetings
       The second plenary meeting continued in public.
   (53) The PRESIDENT - The Executive Board will submit the name together with the draft contract,
   and the General Conference will take a decision by secret ballot. I call upon Sir Ronald Adam.
   (54) Sir Ronald ADAM (Chairman of the Executive Board) - In public session I want to propose two
   draft resolutions on behalf of the Executive Board. The first reads:
      “The General Conference,
       Considering the nomination presented to it by the Executive Board,
       In accordance with Article VI. 2 of the Constitution,
       Appoints Dr. Luther H. Evans as Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
       and Cultural Organization. ”
   (55) The second draft resolution is:
      “The General Conference
       Approves the draft contract presented to it by the Executive Board establishing the terms of
       appointment, salary, allowances and status of Dr. Luther H. Evans as Director-General.”
   (56) The PRESIDENT - I should now like to indicate, for the information of delegates, the rules
   for the conduct of elections by secret ballot. In order to vote, delegations must satisfy the condi-
   tions set forth in Article IV B of the Constitution and Rule of Procedure 79. Before the ballot opens,
   the President appoints two tellers from among the delegates present. The two tellers will be Mr.
   Yukawa, Japan, and Mr. Siller Blanco, Mexico. He will hand them a list of delegations entitled to
   vote and a list of candidates for the election of members of the Executive Board. The Secretariat
   will distribute ballot papers and envelopes to the delegations. Ballot papers and envelopes will be
   of white paper without any distinguishing marks. Blank ballot papers, i. e. those on which there
   are no names will be deemed to be abstentions. Ballot papers on which there are more names than
   one and ballot papers on which voters have revealed their identity, in particular by apposing their
   signature or mentioning the name of the Member State they represent will be considered invalid.
   Ballot papers containing the same number as there are persons to be elected will be ready presently.
   (57) At the election of the Director-General the vote will be on the candidate submitted by the Exe-
   cutive Board. You should not reveal your identity on the ballot papers. You should not indicate the
   State you represent. If your decision is “yes”, mark that column with a cross; if “no”, put a cross
   against the “no” column. Otherwise, leave the paper blank.
   (58) I would remind you that there are two draft resolutions before you. One relates to the election
   of the Director-General and the other to the contract establishing the terms of his appointment,
   salary, allowances etc. Only the election of the Director-General will be balloted now.
       A vote was taken by roll-call.
    (59) The PRESIDENT - The result of the ballot is 39 for and 17 against. Dr. Luther Evans is thus
    the elected Director-General. I call upon the Chairman of the Executive Board.
    (60) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) - May I move the second part of the resolution approving
   the draft contract presented by the Executive Board establishing the terms of appointment, salary,
    allowances and status of Dr. Luther Evans as Director-General, I would like to assure fellow
    delegates that it is in exactly the same terms as Dr. Torres Bodet's and Dr. John Taylor’s, The
   amount is the same and everything else is the same. (1)
    (61) The PRESIDENT - May I take it that the draft resolution meets with your approval? I note
    that it is unanimously approved.
    (62) Mr. PIAGET (Switzerland) - (Translation from the French) I should like to make a brief state-
    ment, or rather two brief statements. The first is that this is a democratic Organization and that,
   therefore, the minority accepts defeat with a smile. The second statement is this. I told you a
    little while ago that Dr. Luther Evans was a good sportsman. Well, we will be just as good sports-
    men as he is, and so shall I for my part. On behalf of the Swiss delegation I pledge him our com-
    plete collaboration in his task, a task of great difficulty - owing to the handicaps I have just indica-
    ted to you.
        The meeting rose at 7. 15 p. m.
    (1) The text is given at the end of the seventh plenary meeting, at which the contract was signed.

RESIGNATION OF DR. LUTHER EVANS FROM THE EXECUTIVE BOARD
(1) The PRESIDENT - I have to inform delegates of the decisions reached this morning in the Gene-
ral Committee. The installation of the new Director-General will take place on Saturday at 10.30
(2) We shall now consider immediately the resignation from the Executive Board of Mr. Ribnikar
and Dr. Luther Evans. The Chairman of the Executive Board will propose the addition of an item
for consideration for the purpose of filling the vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. Luther
Evans from the Executive Board. After that we shall deal with the letters from Czechoslovakia and
Hungary. In the afternoon, we will make a beginning with the Staff Regulations question and then go
on to the contribution of Gandhian outlook and techniques. That is the programme as decided at
present. I now call upon Sir Ronald Adam.
(3) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) (Chairman of the Executive Board) - Resulting from the
election yesterday, I have the authority of Dr. Luther Evans to announce his resignation from the
Executive Board. That leaves a vacancy on the Board for the United States member.
(4) The PRESIDENT - I take it that the addition of this item to the agenda has the approval of the
General Conference.
 CONSIDERATION     OF THE  RESIGNATION   OF MR. VLADISLAV RIBNIKAR FROM THE           EXECUTIVE BOARD

                                                                                                Paris, 2 July 1953
  “To the President of the General Conference
   Sir,
   I am instructed by Dr. Vladislav Ribnikar to inform you that, to his deep regret, he finds it im-
   possible to withdraw his resignation as he feels that the reasons which he gave to the Unesco Gen-
   eral Confernce at its last session still hold good.
      Needless to say Dr. Ribnikar will always be ready to assist personally in achieving the lofty
   ideals pursued by Unesco and to do all that lies within his power in this direction.
                                                                                    I have the honour to be, etc.,
                                                                                        Dr. Sinisa Stankovic,
                                                                                      Delegate of Yugoslavia. ”

   (6) The PRESIDENT - I am sorry that Mr. Ribnikar persists in his resignation. We accept it with
   the utmost regret and we express our appreciation of his great services to the Executive Board and
   to the Conference during the time he officiated here. The Nominations Committee will meet at once
   to elect two members in place of Mr. Ribnikar and Dr. Luther Evans.
    (7) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) (Chairman of the Executive Board) - I should like, if I may,
   to say a few words on behalf of those members of the Executive Board who knew Dr. Ribnikar. He
   was a highly valued member of the Board and we all personally regret his decision. He contributed
   a great deal to our meetings. He did not talk much, but his advice was always sound and to the
   point. We all felt we had a friend on the Board, and it is with the deepest regret that we now learn
   that his resignation is irrevocable. I did my best to persuade him not to go, but I failed. I wish to
   pay a tribute to him here and to express the great regret of all the members of the Board.
       The meeting rose at 11.5 a. m.

    REPORT OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE; ELECTION OF TWO MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE
    BOARD
    (1) The PRESIDENT - I call upon the Chairman of the Nominations Committee.
    (2) Mr. BENDER (Netherlands) (Chairman of the Nominations Committee) - Mr. President and
   fellow delegates, I have the honour to report that the Nominations Committee met at noon today to
    consider the nomination to the General Conference of members of the Executive Board to fill the va-
    cancies caused by the resignations of Dr. Luther Evans and of Mr. Ribnikar. I have been asked by
   the President to tell you that on 2 July 1953 he received a letter from Dr. Luther Evans resigning
    from his position on the Executive Board. In accordance with a proposal which was unanimously
   approved, the nominations for the vacant seats were considered separately. The proposal of the
    Head of the United States delegation was that Dr. John A. Perkins, United States of America, should
    be elected to serve until the close of the Ninth Session for the unexpired term of office of Dr. Luther
    Evans. This suggestion was supported by the Heads of the delegations of the Netherlands and of
    Brazil and was adopted by acclamation. Perhaps, Mr. President, you would like to deal with this
    case first,
    (3) The PRESIDENT - We shall take up this question first. The Nominations Committee has nom-
    inated unanimously, by acclamation, Dr. Perkins for the unexpired portion of Dr. Luther Evans’
    membership of the Executive Board. Does this General Conference approve of that nomination?
                                                           - 44 -

 He is now elected unanimously a member of the Executive Board.                 I call upon the Chairman of the
 Nominations Committee.
 (4) Mr. BENDER (Netherlands) (Chairman of the Nominations Committee) - The Head of the United
 Kingdom delegation, supported by the Heads of the delegations of Mexico, Spain and Canada, pro-
 posed the nomination of Dr. Hermann Zeissl, Austria. The Head of the Chinese delegation, sup-
 ported by the delegations of Brazil, Japan and India, proposed the nomination of Mr. Nathaniel
 Massaquoi, Liberia. In accordance with the Rules of Procedure a secret ballot then took place. The
results of the ballot were as follows: Dr. Zeissl, 22 votes; Mr. Nathaniel Massaquoi, 21 votes.
 The number of Member States entitled to vote at this session is 62. The number of delegations ab-
 sent from the meeting of the Nominations Committee was 16. The number of abstentions recorded
was 2. The number of invalid voting papers was one. The number of votes recorded was 43. The
 number of votes constituting the majority required for election was therefore 22, thus giving the
result which I announced earlier. It is therefore my privilege to propose to you the name of Dr.
 Zeissl, Austria, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Vladislav Ribnikar.
(5) The PRESIDENT - The General Conference has before it the nomination of Dr. Zeiss1 to the
vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Ribnikar of Yugoslavia. Are there any comments or sug-
 gestions? I call upon the delegate of China.
(6) Mr. CHEN Yuan (China) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, according to the report of the
Chairman of the Nominations Committee the voting this morning was very close, and the majority
of one candidate over the other was only one vote. According to this report sixteen Member States
were absent from the Conference room. Such being the case, I suggest that it is only fair that the
names of both the candidates should be put forward again, and the opportunity of voting upon them
should be given. I personally admire and like Dr. Zeissl of Austria very much and should be glad
to see him a member of the Board some day; but I think it more important that the great Continent
of Africa should be represented on the Board, so I propose again the name of Mr. Nathaniel
Massaquoi of Liberia.
(7) The PRESIDENT - Is this seconded ? I recognize the delegate of Brazil, who seconds the pro-
posal. Now we have two names before us - the Nominations Committee’s name, Dr. Zeissl. and
the name of the Liberian candidate, Mr. Nathaniel Massaquoi. Does anyone wish to speak? I call
upon the delegate of Spain.
(8) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) I think we are confronted here
by a question of procedure. The Nominations Committee having met this morning to select a can-
didate, we should first of all decide whether or not we accept the candidate it has proposed to us,
and then, if we reject its proposal, go on to consider the other candidates. Otherwise, if we are to
consider both the candidates proposed, there was no need for us to meet this morning and our pro-
ceedings during this hour and a half will have been useless. In my opinion, the decision reached
this morning by the Nominations Committee means that a candidate has been proposed, If that can-
didate is not accepted, we shall then propose another. That was the procedure in the case of Dr.
Luther Evans. Votes were cast for several candidates at the meeting of the Executive Board, but
only one was proposed to us here. The Executive Board put forward only one name to the Nomina-
tions Committee - that of Dr. Luther Evans. If we had not accepted him, we should have perhaps
selected another candidate; but I think we should be misinterpreting the Rules of Procedure if we
now cancel the decision we have reached after so much trouble this morning.
(9) The PRESIDENT - The position in this matter is that, according to Rule of Procedure 95 the
General Conference at each of its ordinary sessions shall elect by secret ballot ten members of the
Executive Board. Only delegates nominated either by the Nominations Committee or by two dele-
gations, before the ballot, may stand for election. Here the other candidate has been suggested by
two delegations. Thus, the Nominations Committee has suggested one name, and the other candidate
has been put forward by two delegations. The candidature is therefore valid and we have thus to
proceed to a vote by ballot. I take it that is agreed. Are there any other nominations? The tellers
will be from the delegations of Sweden and Peru.
   A vote was taken by roll-call.
(10) The PRESIDENT - Here are the results of the election: Member States entitled to vote at the
session, 62. Number of States absent, 6. Abstentions, 2. Number of invalid votes, none. Number
                                                        - 45 -

  III-4                                       Plenary        Meetings
  of valid votes recorded, 54. Number of votes constituting the majority required, 28. Mr. Nathaniel
  Massaquoi, 30 votes. Dr. Zeissl, 24 votes. I declare Mr. Nathaniel Massaquoi elected a member
  of the Executive Board until the end of the Eighth Session of the General Conference. That will
  complete the unexpired period of Mr. Ribnikar’s mandate. The Acting Director-General has a
  statement to make.
  COMMUNICATION FROM THE ARGENTINE EMBASSY
  (11) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - The Conference will recall that, at the opening of the
  session, a list was read out of Member States which had not paid their recent contributions to the
  point that would entitle them to vote. I have today received a communication from the Embassy of
  Argentina which I think I should read into the record for you:
     (Translation from the Spanish)
    “I have the pleasure of informing you that the sum of 60.181.945 French francs, the amount of
     Argentina’s contribution for 1951, has been placed at the disposal of Unesco by the Argentine
     Government.
         At the same time I would ask the Director-General to be good enough to inform me into what
     bank account this sum should be paid. ”
  INTERPRETATION OR AMENDMENT OF STAFF REGULATIONS WITH RESPECT TO STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY
  (12) The PRESIDENT - We shall now consider items 12 and 15 of the revised agenda (2 XC/7 and
  Addenda 1 and 2; 2 XC/10 and 2 XC/DR. 3). In the General Committee this morning it was under-
  stood that we should begin with item 15, the proposal of the United States delegation, as it is more
  comprehensive. If it is adopted, the other fails. If it is not adopted, we shall take up the other. I
  call upon the Head of the United States delegation.
  (13) Mr. SALOMON (United States of America) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, the Govern-
  ment of the United States of America has requested the inclusion of an item on the agenda of the
  Second Extraordinary Session of the Unesco Conference entitled “Interpretation or amendment of
  Staff Regulations with respect to standards of integrity”, and has circulated a draft resolution to be
  considered in this connexion. You have before you copies of document 2 XC/DR. 3. The United
  States of America has submitted this item for discussion, because it deals with the issue, as out-
  lined in the documentation presented in connexion with item 12, which does not place in its proper
  perspective the problem with which Unesco is faced. Item 12 deals with the “Application to Unesco
  of the Executive Order of the President of the United States of America, dated 9 January 1953”.
  And the documentation thereunder calls for no action by the General Conference. The central pro-
  blem which needs to be examined is not in fact the application of any one Member State’s policy to
  Unesco, as this title implies. The central question raised in document 2 XC/7 relates to the inter-
  pretation to be given to the Staff Regulations and the power of the Director-General thereunder with
  regard to the standards of integrity to be applied. This is a matter wholly distinct from and of far
  more concern than the procedures of relationship between Unesco and any one government. Because
  this larger question is of paramount importance, we believe it is one with which all Member States
  are concerned, and it is therefore one upon which action by this Extraordinary Session of the General
  Conference is necessary.
  (14) The resolution which the United States of America is proposing is designed to meet the im-
  portant issue in a manner consistent with what has always been basic Unesco policy, namely, to
  harmonize Unesco personnel policies with that of the United Nations. This is altogether logical and
  reasonable. Let us examine the matter before us and the implications of the United States draft re-
  solution in more detail.
  (15) The effect of what the Director-General and Executive Board report in document 2 XC/7 as the
  interpretation of the Staff Regulations to date is to render the Director-General powerless to act to
  protect the interest of the Organization in the face of evidence that convinces the Director-General
  that there is a real, not remote - I repeat real - likelihood of a staff member engaging in subversive
  activity against a Member State. This is in striking contrast to the position of the Secretary-General
  of the United Nations.
  (16) The interpretation raises two issues. One question is that of the adequacy of Unesco’s authority
  to administer its own affairs so that it can maintain the high quality required in an international
  civil service. The other is the question of achieving and maintaining consistency between Unesco’s
  personnel policies and those of the United Nations and of the other Specialized Agencies.

                                              Plenary       Meetings                                     III-4
 (17) In order that the staff of Unesco may serve the interest of the Organization, the appointment
 and tenure of staff have been placed in the hands of the Director-General, operating under policies
 laid down by the General Conference. No one government can dictate that a particular person be
 appointed to the staff, nor can it dictate that his services be terminated. These decisions must be
 made by the administrative authorities of the Organization. This view has always been upheld and
 continues to be upheld by the Government of the United States of America in common with the rest
 of the governments. Out of this policy has grown a concept of international civil service, each
 member of which occupies a special position of trust and confidence.
 (18) This places upon the officials of Unesco a heavy responsibility for the selection of staff. At
 best, the staff should be regarded by Member Governments as trusted friends and co-workers. At
 the very least, the governments of Unesco or any international organization should have the right to
 expect that the organization would not retain on its staff any person who is a threat to the very
 foundations of a Member State.
 (19) This entire question has been considered by the United Nations. After a thorough review of
 United Nations personnel policy to date, during the course of which the advice of three international
 jurists was obtained, the Secretary-General of the United Nations arrived at the conclusion that the
 United Nations should not employ, or continue in employment, any person the organization found to
 be engaged, or likely to be engaged in subversive activities against a Member State. The decision,
 of course, must be his own and not that of a Member State. He also concluded, and the international
 jurists so advised, that there was ample authority under the Staff Regulations to implement such a
 policy.
 (20) As a result of General Assembly consideration of this policy and its action at its Seventh Ses-
 sion, the Secretary-General of the United Nations retains the authority to follow such a policy and
 the Assembly plans to review how this authority has been administered at the Eighth Session and to
 consider whether further action by the Assembly, if any, is necessary.
 (21) The purpose of the United States draft resolution which is before you is to affirm that the
Director-General of Unesco has similar authority without prejudicing the outcome of a further re-
view of this question by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its next session. At the last
 session of the General Conference, Unesco adopted Staff Regulations similar to those of the United
Nations in the belief that international organizations in the United Nations should follow a common
personnel policy, It is altogether logical and desirable that, when regulations are made uniform,
 so should the interpretations thereof. It would be impossible to maintain a common personnel
policy among United Nations and its Specialized Agencies if eleven different agencies - or even two -
were to adopt different interpretations as to standards of integrity and the fundamental obligations
expected of staff members.
(22) The granting of such powers to the Administrative Officer are safeguarded in Unesco as in the
 United Nations against abuse by the fact that the administration of such powers is subject to the
review of the General Conference, and the individual staff member has a clear-cut right of appeal
to an independent tribunal. The United States draft resolution specifically calls for a review of
action taken by the Director-General at the next session of the General Conference.
(23) Furthermore, as I have talked with other delegates about the substance of this draft resolution
circulated by the United States delegation, certain questions have been asked which I believe derive
from basic misunderstandings. These are reasonable questions and I would like therefore to say a
word by way of further explanation.
(24) It has been asked, for example, if the United States draft resolution would in practice subject
Unesco’s administration to the control of one or more national governments? I do not believe this
to be the case. It is not intended to impose the will of any one Member State upon Unesco either in
respect to its own nationals or those of any other Member State. It is rather to underline the author-
ity of the Organization itself over its own Secretariat. The exercise of that authority rests exclu-
sively within Unesco itself, as does the responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the staff.
(25) We have never deviated from the proposition that the authority to employ and to discharge rests
exclusively with Unesco under the regulations and policies determined by the General Conference.
There is no intention of the present Government of the United States of America to deviate from this
concept, which is essential to the success of the United Nations system.
(26) I have been told that there is concern that the exercise of authority by the Director-General
may become arbitrary even if it is not dominated by the will of a Member State. Actually the staff
of Unesco is thoroughly protected against arbitrary action by many provisions in the Staff Regula-
tions and staff rules, and notably by a comprehensive appeals procedure, including access to the
Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization. In addition, the General Confer-
ence to whom the Director-General is responsible regularly reviews the work of the Organization
and our resolution specifically calls for a report on this subject at the Eighth Session of the General
Conference,

   (27) I do not believe - my Government does not believe - that the interpretation contained in the
   United States draft resolution constitutes in any way a threat to the proper status, professional well-
   being and competence of international civil servants. Nor does it represent any departure from ac-
   cepted principles of justice and respect for freedom of thought which is the inherent principle of
   Unesco. In fact, the policy proposed to you by this draft resolution should bring even greater res-
   pect for the Unesco Secretariat, and its fair administration should remove any legitimate grounds
   for lack of confidence in the Unesco staff which may exist even in the most sceptical and doubting
   minds, wherever they might be.
   (28) Just one further word about our draft resolution. As far as shortness of time has permitted,
   we have taken counsel with many delegations present at this Conference. We wish we had the time
   to see more of our fellow delegates. The resolution now before you represents considerable chan-
   ges from our original draft. These changes have been made in the light of suggestions which we
   have received from other delegations. We believe that the resolution as it stands now will satisfac-
   torily help allay any misunderstandings or misgivings which may have been held by delegations here
   present.
   (29) To summarize then, Mr. President, the purpose of the United States resolution is simply to
   record the desire of this General Conference that the interpretations given to Unesco’s staff regula-
   tions can and should be consistent with the interpretation being given now and in the future to the
   same regulations in the United Nations.
   (30) Because the implications of this policy are vital both to the future of Unesco and the support and
   confidence of Member States, we earnestly hope that the General Conference will approve this reso-
   lution.
   (31) The PRESIDENT - I call upon the delegate of Switzerland.
   (32) Mr. PIAGET (Switzerland) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, my Government
   has instructed our delegation to defend the principle of the autonomy and freedom of international
   organizations, in other words to defend the honour and the dignity of the international civil service.
   (33) The problem that has just been put before us is a serious one. It is serious in so far as it
   concerns the autonomy of Unesco, that is to say the separation of powers between an international
   authority and national authorities. It is serious, in the second place, in so far as it concerns
   countries which have international institutions on their territory and which have undertaken to gua-
   rantee the immunity of their international officials. It is quite possible that conflicts may arise
   between the measures that are being proposed to us and the existing agreements between internation-
   al institutions and the countries where they have their seat, for these countries have undertaken to
   respect the freedom of the organizations and the immunity of their officials. The problem is also
    serious because of the psychological repercussions on the staff, which cannot but be perturbed and
   disheartened in certain cases by such measures, though it has need of all its enthusiasm if it is to
    serve the international ideal. For example, during the discussion of this problem in the Board we
   received a delegation from the Unesco Staff Association, which submitted its observations in a
   perfectly dignified and convincing manner, observations which were not always taken into account.
    (34) What, after all, is the heart of the matter? It concerns two points. First, there is the con-
   duct of officials who are already serving in the Organization. As far as that goes, in our present
   position and with the present Staff Regulations, the Director-General has all the powers he needs
   to take action against any possible breaches of international loyalty, and the staff on its side has
   all the powers and the guarantees necessary for defending itself. The problem arises principally,
    however, over candidates for official posts. Here the Organization only appoints candidates approved
   by their Government; the Member States thus already possess all the powers they need to exclude
   undesirable candidates. The temporary measures which the Board voted, against a minority of
   whom I was one, seem to me: (1) entirely useless, because everything can take place between the
    candidate and his Government before he submits his candidature officially to Unesco, and without
    Unesco being concerned in the matter at all; (2) they seem to me dangerous, because they create
    a confusion of powers between the Organization and its Member States; (3) finally, they seem to me
    no less dangerous because, if every Member State were to demand analogous measures, we should
   be confronted with insurmountable difficulties. Nevertheless, the greatest danger in the present
    state of affairs seems to me to be that a discussion like this creates an atmosphere of suspicion and
    in certain cases of demoralization which is in the interests neither of the Organization nor of its
    Member States. The repercussions of the Board’s provisional decisions have already been consi-
    derable; they have led to a profound sense of uneasiness in public opinion and among intellectuals;
    only enemies of international organizations and of collaboration between the peoples can take any
    comfort from this action, and that is not what we want. My Government therefore thinks that the
    present Staff Regulations are entirely satisfactory and that it would be dangerous to meddle with them.

(35) Mr. MUDALIAR (India) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, I think we find ourselves in a
very extraordinary situation which must be seriously considered by every delegate attending this
Conference. The position is not as simple as it was made out to be, for I think there are certain
fundamental considerations which we ought to weigh before we accede to or reject the resolution,
or before we alter it. We have listened with the greatest attention to the speech by the Head of the
American delegation and I, for one, must confess that I have not been able to appreciate why at this
psychological juncture he has found it necessary to introduce a document of this nature for the con-
sideration of the Conference.
(36) As I said, I do not think the matter a simple one. Nor do I think it very relevant that we should
be asked to adopt a procedure that has been adopted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations
or even confirmed by the United Nations Assembly. I should like to repeat what Professor Piaget
has said, namely, that we are an autonomous Organization and our duty and our powers are strictly
defined in the Articles of our Constitution. I need hardly refer to Article X wherein it is stated:
“This Organization shall be brought into relation with the United Nations Organization as soon as
practicable.. This relationship shall be effected through an agreement with the United Nations under
Article 63 of the Charter, which agreement shall be subject to the approval of the General Conference
of this Organization. ” That preliminary step was already taken six years ago when this Organization
was founded, and I should like to emphasize the fact that even that arrangement was subject to the
approval of the General Conference. In other words, therefore, the General Conference is the
supreme authority in questions pertaining to the conduct of its business and its administration. The
purpose of the agreement is indicated in Article X: “The agreement shall provide for effective co-
operation between the two organizations in the pursuit of their common purposes, and at the same
time shall recognize the autonomy of this Organization, within the fields of its competence as de-
fined in this Constitution. ”
(37) The Head of the United States delegation has suggested that, because the Secretary-General has
interpreted the rules in a particular manner, the Director-General of our Organization also was
bound to interpret them in a similar manner. I wish emphatically to repudiate such a suggestion.
In fact, I feel, fellow delegates, that Unesco is the most important Organization among all the Spe-
cialized Agencies and should give the lead in regard to matters pertaining to freedom of thought,
freedom of action and freedom to conduct its affairs in its own manner. In fact, I believe that it is
the particular responsibility of Unesco to guide other organizations, including the United Nations,
in this very important respect. Moreover, it has been indicated that the Secretary-General has
interpreted certain regulations. The regulations are those of the United Nations, and with a view
to ensuring consistency we are asked to follow suit. Let me repeat that co-ordination in regard to
the working of the Specialized Agencies and the United Nations does not mean, and cannot be under-
stood as, subordination in regard to the activities of our Organization. We have our own standpoint;
we desire to maintain our own position in regard to the interpretation of these regulations, and we
are also resolved to see that our Director-General is assured of the support he has every reason to
expect from us and from the whole of this Conference.
(38) Let me now refer to the text of the draft resolution presented to this Conference by the United
States delegation. It begins with the words: “Recognizing that it is desirable for the United Nations
Agencies to follow a common personnel policy; that, toward this end, Unesco has adopted staff
regulations similar to those of the United Nations, in which the fundamental obligations placed on
staff members are the same.. . ”
(39) I welcome that statement. But if the United Nations is thinking of a different policy, it should
not have adopted that policy without prior consultation with these other Agencies which also have a
say in the matter, and which should have been taken fully into confidence before any such new inter-
pretation was adopted. The Head of the American delegation has not suggested why, at this particular
juncture, a new interpretation is sought in regard to the manner in which the regulations have been
interpreted so far. I think we can take it that the Acting Director-General has understood his res-
ponsiblity and has realized how far he should note the obligations of the members clearly defined
in the Articles of the Constitution and in the Staff Regulations, which do not permit of any new inter-
pretation being introduced at this time.
 (40) The second paragraph reads: “Considers that the policy of Unesco in this matter should be
in accord with that of the United Nations with regard to interpreting the obligations of staff members
and the powers of the Director-General to maintain the integrity of the Secretariat. ” I submit that
this is really begging the question and, for the reasons that I have already given, it would be disas-
trous for this Organization, for the autonomous nature of this Organization, and for the responsibi-
lities of the Director-General, if we should all the time be looking to interpretations from the
Secretary-General and from the United Nations to regulate our conduct in regard to our own Secre-
tariat staff. Professor Piaget has referred to the great demoralization that would occur in the
Secretariat. I am prepared to say that there is already evidence of that great demoralization creeping

       III-4                                        Plenary Meetings
       into the Secretariat, and that evidence has been submitted in the very modest and respectful memo-
       randum that the Association has placed before members. I feel therefore that an interpretation
       such as this, the acceptance of a resolution such as this, would vitiate the whole atmosphere of the
       Secretariat and make every member of the Secretariat feel that his obligations are not to an internal
       organization but to something nebulous, something which he himself is not able correctly to appre-
       ciate, and which will therefore make his task all the more difficult.
       (41) Mr. President, I shall be very frank - and I think in these matters and on these occasions a
       little frankness is desirable, even if it may be misunderstood. We had yesterday, in a secret ses-
       sion, the substance of which I am not going to reveal, much evidence of the perplexed state of mind
       of many members. Let me assure you, Sir, from the conversations I have had, that this document,
       or the proposed document, was in the minds of many members. We have appointed a new Director-
       General. He is a gentleman in whom we have very great confidence. Let us not weaken his position
       by adopting a resolution of this kind. He is in a very difficult situation, as he is a national of the
       Government introducing this particular document. His position therefore is none too enviable and
       if we adopt the draft resolution and its implications, that position will become exceedingly embar-
       rassing. Whatever he does, in good faith or not - and I trust and believe that it will always be in
       good faith - will be subject to very severe criticism for various reasons. From that very point of
       view I appeal to my friend, the Head of the United States delegation, not to complicate matters at
       this moment and not to make the task of our future Director-General more difficult than it may al-
       ready be at present.
       (42) Moreover, Mr. President, I do not see why notice has not been taken of the document of the
        Executive Board to which you have referred. The Executive Board, after very careful considera-
       tion, reached this conclusion. I think it is only right that we should have enough faith in our Board
       to feel that they can take the responsibility without any great difficulty, to see that the Organization
        does not suffer, that no Member State suffers and that the Secretariat will discharge its duties as
        it ought to in terms of international obligations. I therefore venture to suggest a small amendment
       to the draft resolution. I propose to delete the paragraph: “Considers that the policy of Unesco in
       this matter should be in accord with that of the United Nations with regard to interpreting the obli-
        gations of staff members and the powers of the Director-General to maintain the integrity of the
       Secretariat. . . ” and to make what is now the third paragraph read: “Requests the Executive Board
       and the Director-General to submit to the Eighth Session of the General Conference a report on the
       conduct and development of personnel policy. ”
       (43) I may also add, Mr. President, that this subject is not closed, even in the United Nations. I
       know for a fact that the whole position is going to be reviewed by the International Civil Service
        Board which is meeting next month, and that body will give its opinion as to the interpretation, re-
       vision or amendment of any of the Staff Rules. Under those circumstances I think it would be ex-
       tremely unfortunate, premature and wholly undesirable to accept the draft resolution in the form in
       which it has been introduced by the Head of the United States delegation, and I respectfully commend
       to you the amendment that I ventured to suggest for your acceptance.
       (44) Mr. STANKOVIC (Yugoslavia) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, fellow delegates,
       the Yugoslav delegation considers that very special attention should be paid to this item in the agenda
       of the General Conference, particularly on account of the negative results which might follow from
       a decision which did not fully correspond with the nature, the aims and the dignity of an Organization
        such as ours.
       (45) When we examine this question, we feel it is necessary, I would say indispensable, to abide by
       the fundamental principles on which this Organization is built and the provisions of the Constitution,
       which lays down in Article VI, paragraph 5: “The responsibilities of the Director-General and of
       the staff shall be exclusively international in character. In the discharge of their duties, they shall
       not seek or receive instructions from any government or from any authority external to the Organ-
       ization. They shall refrain from any action which might prejudice their position as international
       officials. Each State Member of the Organization undertakes to respect the international character
       of the responsibilities of the Director-General and the staff, and not to seek to influence them in the
       discharge of their duties. ” This Article of the Constitution lays particular emphasis on the exclu-
       sively international character of the staff of the Organization, a character which is necessitated by
       its aims and duties.
       (46) Furthermore, Regulation I. 4 of the Staff Regulations prohibits officials of the Organization
       from engaging in any form of activity incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties: “While
       they are not expected to give up religious or political convictions or national sentiment, they shall
       at all times exercise the reserve and tact incumbent upon them by reason of their international res-
       ponsibilities. ” This Staff Regulation makes it clear that the political view of these officials does not
       concern the Organization, but it implies the taking of disciplinary measures for any action, of
                                                               - 50 -

                                             Plenary Meetings                                           III-4
whatever kind, which might prejudice the international character of their position or the reputation
of the Organization itself.
(47) The adoption of a special procedure (the circulation, by Unesco itself, of private question-
naires) designed to check the loyalty of an official of the Organization to the country of which he is
a national would represent the abandonment of the principles which I have just quoted. The intro-
duction of a purely national element in the assessment of the loyalty of officials is a precedent, the
negative results of which might make themselves speedily felt in the work of the Secretariat. When
it comes to selecting a new official, Unesco takes into account the fact that the country of which the
candidate in question is a national, considers him as a loyal citizen, but in our opinion, Unesco, as
an international Organization. should not become an instrument for checking this loyalty.
(48) One thing is certain about the demand in question, so far as it concerns persons who are already
officials of Unesco: any act of espionage or any subversive activity by an official of the Organization,
any activity directed against the interests of no matter what Member State, is a grave breach of the
Staff Regulations which calls for his dismissal. Thus, in any particular case, any Member State
can demand the application of the Regulations in this sense, but in such a case the Member State
putting forward the demand is bound to submit to the Director-General proofs that the official con-
cerned has been engaged in activities contrary to the Regulations of the Organization. The position
is very different if the dismissal of an official is to be demanded on nothing but the “a priori” hypo-
thesis that he might possibly engage in espionage or in subversive activity. It is our view that this
would not be in accordance with the Organization’s Staff Regulations, and that the adoption of such a
standpoint would not only require a modification of these Regulations, but would introduce an ele-
ment of instability into the position of the officials which might create an atmosphere of fear and of
pressure in the Secretariat, among whose ranks it would be difficult for the independence and the
international character of the Organization to survive. Naturally a further result of this would be
a repercussion on the reputation which the Organization enjoys in the world.
(49) The Yugoslav delegation agrees with the point of view expressed by the Executive Board at its
Thirty-third Session, according to which the refusal by an official to complete a questionnaire not
drawn up by the Organization is not in itself a ground for disciplinary action, since in such a case
officials are required to comply only with the provisions of the Organization’s Regulations. But the
Yugoslav delegation also considers that Unesco should not even circulate to its officials, or to can-
didates for posts in the Organization, the questionnaires which certain Member States might wish to
address to their nationals, for an international organization should not serve as the instrument of
any Member State, even from a technical point of view.
(50) The Yugoslav delegation therefore considers that:
   the existing provisions and procedures for the recruitment of officials satisfactorily fulfil their
   aim;
      the Organization’s present engagement form makes it possible to obtain all the necessary in-
   formation on candidates for posts in the Secretariat, and no measure of enquiry can be applied, in
   regard to officials of the Secretariat, through the instrumentality of the Organization, on the re-
   quest of any individual Member State, since this is in contradiction with the international spirit
   in which Unesco was conceived, by means of which alone it can fulfil the great tasks that devolve
   on it, and with the actual provisions of the Constitution and the Staff Regulations.
(51) The Yugoslav delegation wishes to emphasize yet again that this matter involves an extremely
important question of principle and that it is indispensable that the General Conference should con-
sider it with the utmost attention, for it is not to be tolerated that the smallest doubt should for an
instant be felt with regard to the independence and the international character of the Organization.
(52) In conclusion, I should like to say a few words about the draft resolution tabled by the United
States delegation which I have just this moment read; the Yugoslav delegation is not satisfied with
this draft. It is not sufficiently clear and it does not bring out the essential point, that is to say that
Unesco should confine itself strictly to the provisions of its Constitution and its Staff Regulations.
Again, the draft would adjourn any decision on a concrete case which appears on the agenda and which
has been brought up by a Member State. The Yugoslav delegation considers that the Conference
should adopt a clearer and more definite attitude on a question whose importance for the Organiza-
tion’s dignity and prestige can escape no one.
(53) Count d’ASPREMONT LYNDEN (Belgium) - (Translation from the French) The draft resolution
placed before us by the United States delegation is designed to achieve an aim of which the Belgian
delegation entirely approves, that is to say, that the Specialized Agencies of the United Nations in
general, and Unesco in particular, should bring their policy into harmony with that of the Secreta-
riat of the United Nations as far as the rights and duties of international officials are concerned. It
would be no less contrary to logic than to equity if the criteria of loyalty applicable to international
officials varied according to the country which is the seat of the organization to which they
                                                        - 51 -

    belong and if the same rules were not applied in Paris and Rome as in Geneva and New York.
    (54) Nothing could do more harm to the interests and prestige of the institution of the United Nations
    than if the severity of decisions in this delicate matter were to be influenced by views on the loyalty
     of officials which varied from country to country, The loyalty of international officials should be
    judged, not by national criteria, but by criteria proper to these international institutions; these
     criteria should be identical for all the organizations of the United Nations. That means that we are
     in complete agreement with the aim of the draft resolution submitted to us. All the same, I must
    admit that the text we have before us does not give us entire satisfaction, for its wording contains
     elements of uncertainty and misunderstanding. It appears to relate to a policy which is said to have
    been formulated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and approved by the Seventh As-
     sembly in the second part of its session. However, when I look at the text. of resolution 708(VII),
    which was voted by a large majority on 1 April 1953, I perceive that this by no means constitutes a
     100 per cent approval of the report presented by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In
    the course of the discussion, a number of delegations representing countries of the free and demo-
     cratic world - for example, those of the Netherlands, Sweden, France and the United Kingdom, not
    to speak of our own country - expressed opinions that were by no means indulgent to the Secretary-
     General’s report. The resolution which was adopted at the end of the debate begins by recalling
     Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter, which define in terms of general principles the duties of offi-
     cials of the Secretariat; it then expresses its confidence that the Secretary-General will in future
     conduct personnel policy with the considerations contained in these Articles and in his report in
     mind. Finally, it asks him to submit a new report to the Eighth Session of the Assembly after having
     sought the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, and also
     that of the administrative heads of the Specialized Agencies. All this shows that no definitive policy
     on criteria for the assessment of the loyalty of international officials has as yet been laid down. This
     is confirmed by the fact that a number of officials of the Secretariat have appealed to the Adminis-
     trative Tribunal over decisions taken in their case, “and that it has yet to pronounce on these mea-
     sures. We must also, I feel, take into account another element, one of fact: the Secretary-General
     of the United Nations, whose discretion in the assessment of these criteria is absolute, has changed.
     (55) For all these reasons it would seem that no policy on the rights and duties of international of-
     ficials has yet been definitively laid down by the General Assembly of the United Nations. In these
     circumstances, the Belgian delegation believes that the draft resolution which has just been put
     before us is premature and that no document of this kind will have real significance and real author-
     ity till the General Assembly of the United Nations, at its Eighth Session next autumn, has pro-
     nounced on the report which it requested the Secretary-General to present to it by resolution 708
     (VII) which it voted on 1 April 1953. My opinion, like that of the eminent delegate of Switzerland to
     whom we have just listened, is in favour of the maintenance of the “status quo”,
     (56) Mr. MARIE (France) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
     the very modest aim I have set myself in rising to speak - I should like to make it clear at once -
     is to persuade your Organization, in view of the variety of proposals which it already has before it
     and which may yet remain to be put forward, to instruct a drafting committee to lay down with pre-
     cision the rules which the new Director-General of our Organization is to follow in the preparation
     of the report which we are all agreed in asking him to submit on the eve of the Eighth Session.
     (57) You will readily understand why I feel I should urge that we should not vote here, in the at-
      mosphere of this General Conference, on resolutions whose discussion we have followed so atten-
     tively, and why I believe it to be necessary to compare these drafts and to take note of possible
     amendments in the tranquillity of a special committee. The speeches of the eminent delegates of
     Belgium, Switzerland and India have made us all realize that the question with which we are dealing
     today goes right down to one of those sentiments that inspired us possibly with the greatest ardour
     when it brought us together in the fold of Unesco. When I say that, I base myself on the act of faith
     which was at the very origin of our Organization; I base myself on the actual terms of the Conven-
     tion which established our Organization, and in which, with a unanimous enthusiasm and fervour,
     the Governments of the States which set their names to it declared on behalf of their peoples that
     the dignity of man demanded the diffusion of culture and the education of humanity for justice, liberty
     and peace. The same instrument stated, in Article I, that the Organization should further universal
     respect for justice, for the rule of law, and for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the
     third paragraph of this Article laid down that “with a view to preserving the independence, integrity”
      - a word which we shall come across again in a moment and over whose interpretation we shall
     have to linger - “with a view”, I was saying, “to preserving the independence, integrity and fruitful
      diversity of the cultures and educational systems of the States Members of this Organization, the
     Organization is prohibited from interfering in matters which are essentially within their domestic
     jurisdiction. ” Such were the basic principles, the essential principles in which the unanimous
                                                             - 52 -

enthusiasm of all the United Nations then expressed itself: this enthusiasm was to prescribe to the
officials of Unesco, to the staff of our international Organization, the elementary rules of their be-
haviour. The Staff Regulations laid down these rules in precise terms at the Seventh Session of our
Organization, in 1952. Regulation I. 4 set forth - and it was you who voted it unanimously in this
very hall - the duties and the obligations of the staff of Unesco.
(58) Here is what it says and in my view its liberal interpretation, indeed its exact, not to say
strict interpretation, should suffice to determine the relationships of our Organization and its staff.
“Members of the Secretariat shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner consonant with the
good repute and high purposes of the Organization and their status as international civil servants.
They shall not engage in any activity that is incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties.
They shall avoid any action, and in particular any kind of public pronouncement, which would ad-
versely reflect upon their position as international officials. While they are not expected to give up
their religious or political convictions or national sentiment, they shall at all times exercise the
reserve and tact incumbent upon them by reason of their international responsibilities. ”
(59) Such are the rules which today govern the behaviour incumbent on our staff and the staff of the
Secretariat. There are perhaps some of us here who feel that the precise application of these rules
is sufficient to determine the conditions of the activity of this staff. There are some of us who
think - and I am glad to associate myself here with the idea of our friends of the great American
democracy - there are some of us who think that it is not possible for an official of the Secretariat of
Unesco to dissociate in his mind the rules of international propriety from national rules. It is hardly
possible to love the whole world, to love humanity, to serve the world and humanity, unless one be-
gins by loving and by serving one’s own country. That is why the judicious interpretation of these
documents appeared to us to be a sound rule, and one in complete conformity with the Convention
which is the basis of our Organization. Our eminent colleagues of the great American democracy
have, however, submitted a proposal to us; I believe that this draft calls for certain clarifications.
It is because a number of us feel these clarifications to be indispensable that I address myself to
them with a friendliness which I do not imagine they doubt, which they cannot doubt, and I ask them
to agree to the proposal which I am putting forward: to submit all the draft resolutions to a special
drafting committee. The draft resolution which our colleagues of the American delegation have put
before us begins by asserting a principle which, with some reservations as regards its form, com-
mands, I should think, the unanimous support of the delegates present here. It states that it is de-
sirable for the United Nations Agencies to follow a common personnel policy. It recalls that Unesco
has in fact, with a view to respecting this principle, adopted staff regulations similar to those of the
United Nations, in which the fundamental obligations placed on staff members are the same.
(60) I think I can say there is no objection to this first section of the preamble. The motion then
goes on: “Considers that the policy of Unesco in this matter should be in accord with that of the
United Nations”. We are still in agreement as regards the interpretation of the obligations of mem-
bers of the staff and of the Director-General’s powers to safeguard the integrity of the Secretariat.
That is true, but perhaps there are some of you, ladies and gentlemen, who might be prepared to
vote the resolution, who can see themselves being asked: Since you want the interpretations to be
similar, since you want us here to align our interpretation on that of the United Nations, just what
is that United Nations interpretation ? What are the norms, what are the rules, laid down by the
United Nations? I do not criticize them, I express no judgment on them, I merely want to know what
they are, and I ask for a report from our Director-General - whom I congratulate, for here I must
associate myself with the courageous attitude taken yesterday by our colleague, Mr. Piaget, on his
fine election - indicating what are the rules which we ought to follow. What is the interpretation?
Is it not natural and the merest common sense that the Director-General of the international orga-
nization should come to us with a detailed and circumstantial report and should tell us: “You de-
clared that the rules and their interpretation should be similar; we are agreed. Here, then, are the
rules followed, and here is how they are followed. ” For we are being asked here to vote for an
alignment, to vote for an adaptation to rules of which we know - I am sorry to say - neither the pre-
cise range, nor on what resolution, on what decision or even on what collective or individual pro-
posals they may be founded. What is more serious is the last paragraph. It does not ask the Direc-
tor-General to give us information on this matter or to define our duty on these various points so
that, having laid down the principle of a necessary similarity, we shall be agreed on the application
of the same rules, the same principles and the same methods. On the contrary it asks him to sub-
mit to the General Conference at its Eighth Session a full report on the progress he has made in the
conduct and development of personnel policy. That means that without knowing what similarities
we want to establish, or with what rules we want to establish them and according to what methods
the rules are to be applied, we are asking the Director-General to report to us at Montevideo on
what he has been able to do in this field of which, you will allow me to say, the resolution defines
exactly neither the directives nor the implications.

  (61) That is why it has seemed necessary to the members of the French delegation and, I hasten to
  add, of a very fair number of other delegations, to make our point of view quite clear. Our point
  of view is not a hostile one: it consists in a desire for clarification, a demand for precision in the
  terms employed, a precision that is necessary if definite action is to follow from it. The draft re-
  solution which we are tabling, Mr. President, records our agreement on the principles laid down
  and on our adhesion to these principles, an adhesion which has already been stated by the delegate
  of Belgium who preceded me here, which I feel should satisfy our colleagues of the American del-
  egation. Here is what we say:
     “Noting that it is desirable for the United Nations and their Specialized Agencies to follow a com-
      mon personnel policy and that towards this end Unesco has adopted staff regulations similar to
      those of the United Nations, in which the fundamental obligations and guarantees of staff members
      are identical. ”
  (62) I ask you to take note of the fact that this first paragraph, this first part of the preamble, takes
  over almost word for word the first part of the preamble of the motion we are discussing. I will
  continue:
     “Recalling, in these circumstances, the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article VI of the Con-
      stitution of Unesco. ”
  (63) In the text that follows we refer to two decisions taken by the General Assembly of the United
  Nations at its last session. Here is what we say:
     “Taking note of the fact that by resolution 708 (VII), adopted on 1 April 1953, the General Assembly,
      after recalling Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter,
      (a) requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its Eighth Session a
            report on the progress made in the conduct and development of personnel policy, together
            with the comments of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
            thereon;
       (b) invites the Secretary-General and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
            Questions to submit, after appropriate consultations with the administrative heads of the
            Specialized Agencies, recommendations as to any further action that may be required of the
            General Assembly. ”
   (64) After this reference to the decisions voted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on
   1 April 1953, the motion I am submitting for your approval continues in the following manner - and
   I think that here I am giving complete and absolute satisfaction to my colleagues of the United States
   delegation:
     “Expresses the wish that the policy of Unesco in this matter should be in accord with that of the
       United Nations in regard to the obligations imposed on and the guarantees offered to the person-
       nel of the Organization. ”
   (65) The inclusion of duties inevitably means, in the case of any synallagmatic contract, the inclu-
   sion of rights as well. We conclude:
     “Therefore requests the Director-General to report on this question to the Eighth Session of the
       General Conference, in the light of such measures as may have been taken in this field by the
       General Assembly of the United Nations. ”
   (66) Thus the draft which we have the honour to submit, though not for your immediate approval -
   I think that in a matter of this kind which so profoundly involves the feelings of all of us it would do
   serious harm to the higher interests of Unesco if this meeting had to decide between two drafts as
   though there were some divergence or some hostility between the motives that lie behind the two -
   the draft, I say, which we are asking you to send to a drafting committee, gives satisfaction to the
   principle of a necessary similarity between the rules followed at the United Nations and those which
   should be followed in Unesco. That is the great principle set forth in the first paragraph of the
   United States motion, and on this point there is no difficulty, and as we are going to meet at Monte-
   video, as you have already decided, we have added to the task you have assigned the Director-Gen-
    eral for this Montevideo session, an additional duty in order to conform to the wish expressed in
   the United States motion. We ask the Director-General to provide us with the clarifications which
   we do not possess today.
    (67) There are two great international organizations: the United Nations, a political Organization,
    and Unesco, a cultural Organization. In this field it is incontestably for the political Organization -
    and on this point everyone is agreed - to take the first steps. We ask the Director-General to in-
    form us at the Eighth Session of the action taken and the applications that may have been made with-
    in the United Nations, in order that Unesco may then, with a full knowledge of the facts, after re-
    iterating its desire for a similarity between the policies followed by the United Nations and Unesco,
    be able to take the necessary measures in its own domain. I maintain that this draft is a clear
    draft, that it is a conciliatory draft, that it is a draft against which it is impossible to bring up any
    criticism or make any reservation. If, in its form, any of its terms inspire reservations,
                                                            - 54 -

misgivings or criticism, we should be only too glad to give way. It is just because we feel it nec-
cessary in this field to end up with a unanimous vote that we respectfully request the General Con-
ference, Mr. President, not to consider this draft here and now, but to consider all the drafts, with
the amendments tabled by the delegate of India, in order that a committee faithfully representing
the different opinions expressed here shall be able to submit to us tomorrow a draft resolution on
which, in the interests of Unesco’s greatness and prosperity, we can unanimously achieve our com-
plete agreement.
(68) Mr. DAOUD AMMOUN (Lebanon) - (Translation from the French) I think that it would be in
our interest to fall in with the proposal Mr. Marie has just made.
(69) Only four officials out of ninety-two have failed to reply to the questionnaire. The matter with
which we are dealing is therefore largely academic. The substance of the difference between the
interpretation given by the Acting Director-General and that which may have been given by the
United Nations - on which, as was quite rightly observed just now, we have not yet any definitive
data - concerns a precise point. Have we got to punish “actual” misconduct or what the document
calls “potential” misconduct ? The Head of the United States delegation himself told us that the
question raised at certain moments was the subversive activities in which an official had engaged
or might engage.
(70) Our aim is twofold: we have at the same time to safeguard certain principles and to preserve
the efficiency and integrity of the Secretariat of Unesco. For my own part, I should like to strike
a realistic note and to say how anxious we are to respect the desires of a State which has been and
which continues to be in the vanguard of culture and of civilization and to which our Organization
owes so much in the moral and intellectual as well as in the material field. I say this for the Head
of the United States delegation. We can safeguard the principle and the clearly expressed wish of
this State without stirring up the feelings of which you have just been hearing the echoes at this
rostrum.
(71) During the French Revolution there were convicted persons, aristocrats, suspects and a
further category: those who were suspected of being suspects. We should be following in the same
path if we were to adopt the principle of potential misconduct. I am speaking without irony, and I
understand that there are moments when certain States may wish to go as far as that in defending
themselves.
(72) Mr. Piaget, however, was telling us just now something on which I should like to have con-
firmation, that in fact no official is appointed without the agreement of his Government. In these
circumstances, have not the United States delegation and the United States Government complete
satisfaction already, without bringing up questions of principle which threaten to divide us, and with-
out appealing to the many values to which we are all equally attached, but with different interpreta-
tions? Only four officials have not replied. That settles the past. In future, no official will be
appointed without the previous agreement of his Government. If these facts are established - and
on this point I have not yet had any very clear confirmation, but we will ask the Director-General
and Mr. Piaget himself to give it to us presently - I think the discussion becomes meaningless. On
the question of principle of bringing the interpretation of our regulations into harmony with those of
the United Nations, we could fall in with the French proposal and leave it to a drafting committee to
find a formula which will reconcile all the ideas expressed in the course of this debate.
(73) Furthermore, from the procedural point of view once more, there is a co-ordinating commit-
tee of all the directors of the international organizations which meets at regular intervals. Not so
very long ago our Acting Director-General attended it, and this question might with advantage be
examined and perhaps even solved by it.
(74) We are all agreed in feeling that from the moment a man becomes an international official,
without renouncing either his convictions or his principles, he must accept certain limitations on
the expression of these convictions. But once again, I do not think we need embark on a discussion
which is without object, since in fact no official is appointed without the agreement of his Govern-
ment. I should therefore like to ask the United States delegation, because we should regret to have
to vote against it on a point which it may have at heart, to withdraw this motion. There is only one
official who has been appointed without the previous approval of the United States Government, and
that is an exception which I hope the United States Government will not hold against the General
Conference: it is that of Dr. Luther Evans, whom we yesterday appointed Director-General.
(75) Mr. AGUNG GDE AGUNG (Indonesia) - After studying the documents relating to this item of
the agenda, I should like, Mr. President, in the first place to express on behalf of my Government
its gratitude for the skilful and able manner in which the Acting Director-General, Dr. John Taylor,
has approached this matter during the past months. His attitude deserves the fullest admiration
and support of this Conference. He has worked hard to maintain the international character of the
                                                       - 55 -

    III-4                                        Plenary       Meetings
    Organization. All of us know that a body like Unesco, whose action depends entirely on the free
    collaboration of the Member States, has to maintain its international character in order not to dis-
    courage the voluntary collaboration of the Members constituting the Organization. Should one of the
     Member States impose its will on the others and act at variance with the rules which bind the Org-
    anization together, internal animosity will obviously prevail. The foundations of the Organization
    will thus be shaken and it will ultimately collapse.
    (76) The application of the Executive Order of the President of the United States of America to
    Unesco officials is a matter which we have to consider attentively and with the deepest and most
    profound concern. We shall thus avoid being faced with the situation I have mentioned. My Govern-
    ment fully endorses the stand taken by the Acting Director-General in this case. His attitude showed
    him to be an ardent defender of the real meaning of the Constitution of Unesco and of the maintenance
    of the international character of the Organization in its real and true sense, That result, however,
    can only be achieved by the wise guidance of the Director-General and this depends largely on the
    self-restraint and attitude of the Member States. If we wish to avoid friction and animosity in the
    Organization, Members must show self-restraint in respecting the Rules and the Constitution of the
    Organization. If every Member State were to impose on the Organization rules drawn from its own
    national law which might conflict with those of the Organization. the end of our international body
    would be very near.
    (77) When we examine the application of the above-mentioned Executive Order of the President of
    the United States of America - this I consider as a further national law or emanation of such a law -
    I am of opinion that it cannot be applied automatically to Unesco as an international Organization.
    Unesco cannot undertake to co-operate in applying the Order to its staff and in forcing its officials
    to submit to it, If Unesco took such action, then I believe that other Member States might also ask
    Unesco to disregard the rules and the Constitution and that might prove disastrous for us. I am con-
    vinced that Unesco officials will never lose their nationality in signing a contract with this inter-
    national Organization. Every Member State is, of course, completely free to deal with its citizens
    as individuals. Those citizens are members of an international body. The officials are expected to
    observe and obey the rules of this international Organization in their work. This international Org-
    anization cannot concern itself with matters which involve the officials as individuals in their rela-
    tions with the States they come from so long as these officials do their work according to the rules
    prescribed by the Organization and its Constitution, and by the Director-General as its highest of-
    ficial. I am of the opinion that there is no reason to brand an official as undisciplined in his rela-
    tions with Unesco when he refuses to carry out or to fulfil something that is outside the scope of
    Unesco methods.
    (78) I am fully aware of the serious character of the United States proposal in this matter. Unesco
    may have to take a crucial decision. The proposal will appear especially serious if we examine
    attentively the letter of the Assistant Secretary of State to the Director-General, dated 20 February
    1953, in which he said, on behalf of Mr. Dulles: “He (Secretary Dulles) believes that it is manifest
    that without this full co-operation the objectives of the Order cannot be achieved, and that without
    such achievement, continued support of these organizations by the United States of America cannot
    be assured. ”
    (79) In the opinion of my Government it would be disastrous for an international organization based
    on the free will of its members to be subjected to rules emanating directy from national regulations
    or laws. Such rules would be in conflict with the actual Constitution of Unesco and would conceal
    within themselves dangerous elements that would threaten the continued existence of the Organization
    and its high purposes as set forth in its Constitution.
    (80) Therefore, Mr. President, I fully endorse the standpoint of the Executive Board in this mat-
    ter, which I deem to be in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution of this Organization. As
    regards the draft resolution of the United States delegation, I think that in its original version and
    wording it is not compatible with the standpoint of the Executive Board. I think it clear that, during
    this plenary session, all the amendments proposed to the draft resolution by previous speakers
    cannot be formulated. I fully endorse the suggestion of the delegations of France and India to form
    a small committee to study the draft resolution and try to amend it so as to bring it into harmony
    with the spirit of the Constitution of Unesco as an international Organization.
    (81) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, fellow delegates,
    before coming to the resolution we are discussing, I should like to make two preliminary remarks.
    The first is to declare my feeling of confidence in the intentions with which the United States dele-
    gation has placed its draft resolution before us. I cannot conceive and I will not for an instant allow
    myself to think that the country which first raised the flag of freedom on the American Continent,
    the country which established the first Republic on our Continent, the country which produced
    Benjamin Franklin, the country which gave us Jefferson, that great statesman who remains a model
                                                           - 56 -

                                             Plenary       Meetings                                       III-4
for every epoch, the country which only yesterday stirred the world’s conscience through the noble
and forceful personality of Franklin Roosevelt, the country which has at its head Eisenhower, the
General of freedom, and which for four years defended throughout the world, with the arms of
millions of young Americans, those sacred principles that are at the root of our Organization and
that led to its creation, I say I cannot for a moment admit that this country intends to put before us
a draft resolution which is contrary to freedom and human rights.
(82) I should like to add that I feel that the servants of Unesco, appointed to this Organization to
carry out a sacred task, have sacred duties. They have not been called here as specialists for this
or that part of a programme and not in their capacity as scholars, educationalists or administrators;
they have been summoned to serve Unesco in order to contribute to the maintenance of peace and of
security by drawing closer the bonds of collaboration between the nations by means of education,
science and culture, so as to ensure universal respect for justice, law, human rights and fundamen-
tal freedoms for everyone. What we have to do with here is an order which should lay upon its
members the same sort of duty as the orders of chivalry used to do and as the religious orders still
do, and their dignity will be all the greater and their security all the better assured once they have
agreed to carry out faithfully the duties which are the reason for their presence in our Organization.
It is with no intention of detracting in any way from the duties of the servants of Unesco towards the
task that falls to them that I am venturing these remarks on the draft resolution before us; on the
contrary, it is because I feel the problem ought to be stated in other terms. The point before us is
not to discuss whether a servant of Unesco should or should not be loyal to his native country, the
point is to know whether Unesco’s officials are or are not loyal to Unesco, because since the voting
of its Charter, Unesco has been the conscience of the United Nations. It was not set up to fulfil a
purely material mission, but to develop in the world the consciousness of freedom inseparable from
the consciousness of order, the reconciliation of the two concepts, order and freedom, which an
Organization like ours is destined to achieve. That is the reason why we have hedged the servants
of Unesco about with a number of guarantees and, at the same time, of responsibilities. The first
of these responsibilities is linked with an obligation which is inherent in the Organization itself: the
Organization is prohibited from intervening in matters which are essentially within the domestic
jurisdiction of its members.
(83) If the Organization is prohibited from intervening in such matters, the same duty is incumbent
on all the servants of this Organization who form part of it and are members of it. Without be-
traying his duties towards our Organization, no servant of Unesco can transgress the conditions
which determined his admission into the ranks of our Secretariat or can allow himself to indulge in
any form of intervention in any matter specifically concerning the States. They shall refrain, says
paragraph 5 of Article VI, from any action which might prejudice their position as international
officials.
(84) What suspicion can fall on an official of Unesco who fulfils his duties towards it? What sus-
picion can fall on an official of Unesco who is obliged - and that is why there is a Director-General
of Unesco, and that is why there is an Executive Board of Unesco - strictly to obey the prescriptions
of our Charter? If a Unesco official fails in his duties towards the Member States of our Organiza-
tion, if he disobeys the clear provisions of this Charter by contributing directly or indirectly to sub-
versive action against any one of them, he is committing an act of disloyalty towards the Organiza-
tion. It is on this plane, gentlemen, that I should like to examine the problem which you have before
you. It is not a question of loyalty to the United States of America, France or Brazil. It is not a
question whether a decree has been signed by President Eisenhower, the President of the French
Republic or the President of my own country. If in our consideration of the duties of Unesco offi-
cials we were obliged to follow the specific laws of our different countries, we should very soon be
drowned in a sea of differing legislations, almost always incompatible, which would lead us and
would lead our Director-General to a chaos of interpretations.
(85) My Government, having taken note of the United States draft resolution, has given me certain
instructions which I shall be happy to examine with you. First of all, it recalls that the United
Nations - and we all know this, the question has been quite clearly discussed here - has not yet laid
down in a precise and final manner the duties incumbent on international officials and the duties in-
cumbent on the directors of these bodies as to sanctions.
(86) There is a very judicious report which will be presented at the next general session and which
will then lay down its definitive lines. My Government also reminds me that in any case, and in any
formula which may be drafted here, it must be recalled in a clear and definite manner that the Se-
cretariat of our Organization has an international and independent character, and that these two points
must be considered as sacred and above all discussion.                    If we have to follow the directives
of the United Nations, we must provide those against whom any accusation may be brought
with all the necessary guarantees for their defence by seeing that they are not left in the
hands of the national courts but are tried by the international jurisdiction which is represented
                                                         - 57 -

     III-4                                       Plenary       Meetings
     by this Conference, the Executive Board and the Director-General.
     (87) Gentlemen, the proposal which the United States Government has submitted to us has allowed
,    of a debate which I believe to have been useful and fruitful, but none of us, in a problem of this com-
     plexity, as rich in shades of meaning as in difficulties, can claim the privilege of having found the
     exact formula, the definitive last word. If our resolution, whatever it may be, is to have the neces-
     sary weight and authority, it must be the collective reflection of our Conference. I hope that the
     Head of the United States delegation will not be insensible to the appeal I am making to him. I have
    never hesitated to contradict the United States delegation whenever I thought it necessary to oppose
    its views. I have therefore the fraternal right to ask it, in my turn, to concur in this idea of a
    common draft which will be hammered out by all the minds that are concentrating on the problem
    and to surround the Secretariat of Unesco with indispensable guarantees and make it understand,
    furthermore, that its duties are sacred duties.
    (88) Sir Ben Bowen THOMAS (United Kingdom) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, I once heard
    of two men standing on the roadside when a funeral passed by, and one turned to the other and asked
    “Whose funeral is this?” and his friend replied: “Mr. So-and-so”; and the first man then asked
    “Is he dead? ” And the second said, “Do you think it’s a rehearsal?” And as I sat here I could not
    help wondering whether we were not having a rehearsal of proceedings at Montevideo. That is to
    say, this draft resolution, in the opinion of the United Kingdom delegation, is premature. The dis-
    cussion that has taken place is really an interim discussion, and I think it should be approached in
    that way. The view of the United Kingdom delegation is that, for the purpose of an interim discus-
    sion, the draft resolution before us submitted by the United States delegation has considerable
    merits. It has the merit of not going into detail in an interim discussion. It does not involve a
    legalistic approach and the presentation of documents as though they were verbally inspired. It
   has, moreover, the merit of not raising general principles that have a tendency also to raise the
   temperature of discussions, and it has within it the possibilities of wisdom. I remember a profes-
    sor many years ago in the University of Oxford telling us never to ask in a crisis, “What are all the
   facts? What is the legal position?” Never ask the question, “What is the principle involved?” Al-
   ways ask, “What is wise?” That is the merit of the United States resolution as I see it here. It
   poses suppositions in the name of wisdom, and I would say that it does this in the name of wisdom,
   for three reasons.
   (89) First of all, it safeguards the staff - and we fully appreciate the anxiety in the minds of the
   staff. There is nothing in this draft resolution that imperils the position of the members of the staff
   of Unesco as from this day onwards. Secondly, it safeguards the position of the Director-General,
   The Director-General is the responsible man. He is not, according to this draft resolution, to be
   dictated to by anything that may happen elsewhere. But he would be the most foolish of men were he
   at the moment to decide that his mind is closed, that whatever happens elsewhere is not relevant to
   him, and that a position that he may have taken up in the past is an unchangeable position and one
   that cannot be altered in any respect and under any conditions. It seems to me that a man in his
   position is bound to have regard to what happens elsewhere, to what happens in New York and in
   other Specialized Agencies, in order that he may be able to reach the wisest decisions possible in
   the interests of the Organization. And then, Mr. President, this resolution has the great merit of
   saying that we, in this Extraordinary Session, are not called upon to reach final decisions. W e
   ask, and I am sure we accept the amendment that was made by a previous speaker at the rostrum,
   that the Executive Board and the Director-General between them shall prepare for the next Confer-
   ence at Montevideo a body of information and guidance based on events that will happen in the
   meanwhile. That will enable us at that particular stage to reach a decision. I would therefore say
  that the United States draft resolution as it stands conforms to the requirements of wisdom and is
   one that would be acceptable.
   (90) On the other hand, I have not been uninfluenced, I hope, by what other speakers have said in
  the debate. I believe that the general trend of the discussion has been in favour of a “get-together”
  to try to produce another form which would be acceptable to us. If that is the view, Mr. President,
  it may be expressed in a short while by the members of the Conference. I wish to say that the
   United Kingdom delegation will support it. But I would add that our delegation sincerely hopes, in
  the first place, that the members who will form the working party will come together with the de-
  sire to achieve a common mind, and not to obtain the ascendancy of their particular point of view.
   Secondly, I would like to say that I hope we shall have confidence in the small number of people who
  will compose this working party. Thirdly, I trust they will not make too great an inroad on our
  time, since time is valuable, and fourthly, whatever the outcome of their deliberations, let it be in
  in such general terms that it will in no way bind the Executive Board and the Director-
  General in the preparation of the paper to which we are looking forward for the Montevideo
  Conference.

(91) Mr. PHOTIADES (Greece) - (Translation from the French) I believe that the brevity which our
Welsh friends sometimes appreciate is indispensable at certain moments of our discussions. I
therefore have the honour, Mr. President, to propose that you name without delay the members of
the committee which will assume the responsibility of preparing a common draft, since I feel we
are in agreement on its substance and that there are only certain small divergencies with regard to
the text. My friend, Mr. Piaget, may still have his doubts, but I am convinced that we shall arrive
at a draft which will obtain unanimous support. I am convinced, I repeat it, that we shall obtain a
draft which will be voted unanimously. I beg you to secure this unanimity, for it is indispensable
to the future of this Organization.
(92) The PRESIDENT - May I ask the Head of the United States delegation to say a word or two?
(93) Mr. SALOMON (United States of America) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, I will not
take up much of your time. In spite of the nature of the discussion carried on by my many eminent
predecessors on this rostrum, the United States delegation remain firm in their belief that the
personnel policy of Unesco should be in accord with the personnel policy of the United Nations.
Several speakers expressed their opposition to this principle. This runs counter, may I remind
you, to Article 57 of the United Nations Charter and to the Agreement concluded between the United
Nations and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. May I take a
moment to read part of Article XIII “Personnel Arrangements”: “The United Nations and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization recognize that the eventual development
of a single unified international civil service is desirable from the standpoint of effective adminis-
trative co-ordination, and with this end in view agree to develop common personnel standards,
methods and arrangements, etc. ”
(94) Beyond the legal interpretation, there should be a common staff policy offering the highest
possible standards for international civil servants, who are the backbone of our international Orga-
nization. These should represent common policies which, at the same time, will safeguard the
basic rights of all international servants and assure our Organization of an efficient, competent staff
devoted to the attainment of the objectives of our Organization, and subversion surely has no place
in these objectives. May I say, fellow delegates, that we are willing to agree, and we consider it
sound wisdom to have a drafting committee that will report back to this Extraordinary Session. We
appreciate the efforts of the distinguished French delegate, Mr. Marie, and our French friends
and others here to strive for common agreement on a matter that is very important to us, a matter
that may well decide the future of Unesco and the great co-operative effort in which we all united
so happily.
(95) Mr. TOSCANO (Italy) - (Translation from the French) The Italian delegation would like to
draw the attention of this Conference to the problem involved in the position of Member States of
Unesco which are not at the same time Members of the United Nations. These States are going to
find themselves in a very special position. In the draft resolution put forward by the United States
delegation, there is a reference to the personnel policy laid down and followed by the United Nations,
but this policy has been laid down with no reference at all to States which, like Italy, are Members
of Unesco but not of the United Nations.
(96) In consequence, and in order to safeguard the autonomy of Unesco, it seems to us desirable
to arrive at decisions which will probably be identical with the decisions of the United Nations, but
which will have to be taken every time in this Organization, where we are represented. The Italian
delegation hopes the drafting committee will take into account the position of States which are not
Members of the United Nations and of the necessity of Unesco reaching decisions which are in form
autonomous, even if in the event they have to coincide with the decisions already adopted by the
United Nations.
(97) Mr. PIAGET (Switzerland) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, I should like to
associate myself with the remarks of the Italian delegate, for my country is in the same position.
I should like also to welcome the effort to reach unanimity to which various previous speakers have
referred, but I should like to make it clear that there remains one point in suspense which no spea-
ker has so far raised: that is the question whether the interim measures taken by the Board will
become permanent till Montevideo, or whether the agreement we are now trying to reach will sus-
pend by its existence the Board’s interim measures. It stands to reason that if the Board’s interim
measures are to continue, my Government will not be able to concur in the thesis in question. My
Government is definitely hostile to these interim measures voted by the Board which were to have
remained in force up to the present Conference and it will not be able to support any motion which
implied the continuation of such measures, which appear to us already to have violated what

   I called the freedom and the dignity of the international institution.
  (98) The PRESIDENT - I take it from the general discussion and the speeches made here and from
  what the Head of the United States delegation has said, that the general sense of the Conference is
  to set up a small drafting committee with the idea of arriving at what Sir Ben Bowen Thomas calls
  a “common mind” on the question raised in the draft resolution moved by the United States delega-
  tion. Am I to take it that that is the general sense ? If so, I propose the following small committee
  of seven: United States of America, France, India, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Italy, Brazil.

   INTERPRETATION OR AMENDMENT OF STAFF REGULATIONS WITH RESPECT TO STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY (contd)
   (1) The PRESIDENT - Yesterday afternoon we appointed a Drafting Committee to submit to us a
   draft resolution on item 15, designed to secure the greatest possible measure of support. That
   Committee will now submit its recommendation to us. I call upon the delegate of the United King-
   dom.
   (2) Mr. BARTLETT (United Kingdom) - Mr. President, fellow delegates,. the Committee which
   you appointed met last night from 9 p. m. to 2 a. m. Our discussion was full, frank, friendly, and
   in spite of the hour was thoroughly enjoyed by all those present. We were called a Drafting Com-
   mittee. We had before us the texts of two draft resolutions, one presented by the delegation of the
   United States of America and the other presented by the delegation of France, but we had to ex-
   change views about matters of substance before we could begin to discuss the drafts. In other words,
   we were something between a Drafting Committee and what one would call a Working Party. You
   will not wish me to impose upon you a summary of so long a discussion. The countries participating
                                                          - 60 -

                                              Plenary       Meetings                                      III-5
in the Drafting Committee explained their personal view to you yesterday afternoon in the plenary
meeting. Subject to one reservation, to which I shall refer later, we were able to arrive, in our
informal and friendly discussion, at unanimous agreement upon the text of the resolution which you
have before you; it is numbered 2 XC/DR/7. I must, however, record one reservation; I regret
that, because I have had to give an account of the proceedings first to the General Committee, I
have not had the opportunity to clear the summary which I shall now give you with the Swiss delegate.
He may wish to correct or amplify my remarks. The Swiss delegation, which contributed most
fruitfully to our discussion on the drafting of the resolution, felt, and their view was shared by at
least one other delegation, that a fundamental point remained outstanding. The Swiss delegation
would have liked to see a paragraph added to the resolution. This paragraph, drafted by the Swiss
delegation, reads as follows: “The General Conference requests the Director-General to suspend
until further decision of the General Conference the application of the interim measures not con-
templated by the Constitution of Unesco and by the Staff Regulations. ”
(3) This reservation, we felt, was a matter for the Committee to report back to you. Subject to
this reservation, as I have said, the Drafting Committee was in unanimous agreement upon the text
of the draft resolution before you, to which each delegation present made its contribution. In the
text, however, there may be two minor omissions, to which I should perhaps draw your attention.
From the French text there may have been omitted the preamble, which in the English text reads:
“The General Conference, at its Second Extraordinary Session. ”
(4) Secondly, in the English text there may be an omission from the paragraph which begins:
“Recalling resolution 708 (VII) adopted on 1 April 1953 by the General Assembly of the United Na--
tions. ” To this clause should be added the word “annexed”, which appears in the French text in the
form “. . . et figurant en annexe”; the text of that annex will be circulated by the Secretariat as soon
as possible.
(5) I should like to add that the Committee’s deliberations were in accordance with the best tradi-
tions of Unesco and such that I am proud to have been associated with them.
(6) Mr. NOGUEIRA (Uruguay) - (Translation from the Spanish) Mr. President, I feel I should first
of all draw the attention of the competent authorities to the advisability or utility - not to say the
necessity - of including representatives of the three working languages of the General Conference
in the drafting committees of any of its organs. In 1946, during the proceedings of the Preparatory
Commission, I asked for the simultaneous distribution of all documents in French and English,
which were then the two working languages, since discussion was almost always based on the English
text. Mr. Jean Thomas, who then represented the Secretariat, will doubtless remember my protests
at that time. I venture to make this observation of an administrative nature because it would not
 surprise me if the appointment of an English-speaking Director-General were to increase the ten-
dency to give priority to that language over French in all Unesco documents, and over Spanish and
 French in the General Conference, where the three languages are on an equal footing. It is clear
that this will not be the case at Montevideo.
 (7) The custom of forming drafting committees by selecting delegates who have spoken during the
 debate is usually explained, though not justified, by the assumption that they are more interested
 in the subject than are those who did not speak. This supposition may be quite untrue. I did not
 speak in yesterday’s debate on the draft resolution submitted by the United States delegation, al-
though my name was on the list of speakers. I withdrew in order not take up the time of the Con-
 ference with my proposal for the appointment of a drafting committee, because the Head of the
 French delegation had already put forward the same proposal in eloquent terms. After hearing
 him I felt it would be presumptuous and tactless of me to insist on speaking. That, however, did
 not signify want of interest. There may have been, and no doubt were, many other Spanish-speaking
 delegates in the same position, whose merits would have entitled them to a seat on the Committee.
 (8) I now wish to refer to the results achieved by the Drafting Committee appointed yesterday by the
 President which, I would like to say first of all, deserves the congratulations of the Conference.
 The chief task of the Drafting Committee was, in my view, to arrive at a satisfactory co-ordination
 of our resolution with the resolution adopted by the United Nations on 1 April 1953, while taking
 care to preserve our complete independence, since it should always be remembered that the United
 Nations is first and foremost a political organization, while Unesco is a technical institution in
 which the political element should be kept down to the unavoidable minimum.
 (9) During the Second General Conference of Unesco, in Mexico, I protested on behalf of the Uru-
 guayan delegation against the introduction of politics into the proceedings. Certain delegates made
 use at that time of an assembly whose purpose was to consider education, science and culture, in
 order to attack the politics, in the strict sense of that word, of the United States of America. On
 that occasion, too, I suggested certain modifications in the Staff Regulations, aimed at stressing
 the independent character of the international civil servants by prohibiting them from accepting
                                                        - 61 -

  III-5                                         Plenary Meetings
   honorary distinctions or Government decorations in recognition of any act performed after they
   joined the Secretariat. We had already put this matter before the Preparatory Commission in
   Paris and before the Sub-Committees of the First General Conference; but it was not possible, at
   that early stage, to frame all the necessary regulations. In the Administrative and External Rela-
   tions Commission of the Second General Conference I again made various proposals for emphasizing
   the international status of the officials. I will not tire you now by repeating what I said in the Pre-
   paratory Commission and in the General Conferences of 1946 and 1947. I will only add that not
   until December 1952 did I have the satisfaction of seeing these provisions incorporated in full in the
   Staff Regulations of Unesco, as the Acting Director-General, Dr. Taylor, opportunely and effect-
   ively recalled in his speech the day before yesterday.
   (10) On 1 April 1953, the United Nations adopted a resolution based on the Articles 100 and 101 of
   the Charter which define the characteristics of the international civil servant, these being funda-
   mentally the same in the United Nations and the Specialized Agencies. The resolution stipulates
   that the next General Assembly should undertake the study of possible reforms in the light of the
   experience acquired in applying those Articles, and invites the Secretary-General and the Advisory
   Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to consult the administrative heads of the
   Specialized Agencies on this problem and to submit their recommendations as to any further action
   that might be required of the General Assembly. I should like to point out in passing that the United
   Nations decided to consult not the Specialized Agencies, but their administrative heads, so that the
   matter would not appear to concern this General Conference, or even the Executive Board, but
   simply our Director-General. This naturally does not prevent the General Conference, which has
   sovereign authority in this matter, from dealing with the subject as it is doing, in order to facili-
   tate the task of the Director-General, who can then put forward his conclusions supported by the
   discussions and decisions of the Executive Board, with which it is his duty to co-operate.
   (11) There may, however, be a difficulty of procedure here, because the United Nations has asked
   its Secretary-General to report to the Eighth Session in September and October next after consul-
   tation with the Director-General of Unesco whom we ourselves have asked to report to the Eighth
   Session of the General Conference to be held at Montevideo a year later. I mention this problem
   of jurisdiction and deadline in case it may be really important because it would then be a good thing
   for the Director-General to know at once how he stands. If that is so, the Drafting Committee will
   naturally have taken the matter into account. In any event, the chief wish of the delegation of Uru-
   guay is, in the first place, that the resolution we are adopting here shall not conflict with the reso-
   lution adopted by the United Nations on 1 April 1953, and in the second place, that Unesco shall
   retain entire independence in matters relating to its Staff Regulations.
   (12) In conclusion, I should like to make a statement of principle regarding the characteristics of
   the international official, as they are clearly defined in the staff regulations of all the international
   organizations. The international official does not represent his own country but, as it were, re-
   presents us all equally. There can be no objection to investigating the activities of one or more
   international officials, provided the person or committee conducting the investigation is also on an
   international footing and has been duly appointed by the institution concerned. Finally, I should
   like to take this opportunity of reminding Dr. Evans of what I said, under his Chairmanship, to
   Dr. Taylor, the Acting Director-General, at a meeting of the Administrative Commission of the
   General Conference last December, with regard to the geographical recruitment of the Secretariat
   and the use of the working languages (Records of the General Conference, Seventh Session, p. 605).
   I thank you, Mr. President.
    (13) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) It seems illogical that a
    “drafting committee” should have been formed yesterday without the inclusion of a single Spanish-
    speaking delegate, since Spanish is the language spoken by the majority of the delegations to this
   Conference. Language is undoubtedly the most important of all the resources at the disposal of our
   Organization in its efforts to promote the ideals of education, science and culture by which it is
    inspired. Language is the tool of our Organization; it is also the means of spreading our work and
    of obtaining entry to the regions we wish to reach.
    (14) Since Spanish is the language spoken in twenty different countries covering almost the whole of
    one continent and part of another, and extending throughout the world, the Spanish delegation has
   the honour to submit the following requests to the President of this Conference:
       1. That a delegate from a Spanish-speaking country shall be included in every committee appoin-
   ted to undertake preparatory work, and more particularly those committees entrusted with the task
   of drafting or collating documents. This would also appear to be advisable in view of the fact that
   about one-third of the delegates normally attending our Conferences are Spanish-speaking and use
   Spanish as their mother tongue, and not merely as a secondary or working language.
    (15) It would, moreover, be in the interest of our Organization to grant this request, for Spanish
                                                          - 62 -

is one of its official working languages and it may be assumed that the Spanish version of a commit-
tee’s conclusions will be more reliable and better expressed than the version of a professional
translator, who is obliged to work on texts already drawn up in other languages.
    2. That the Chairmen of such committees shall take steps to ensure that all texts and docu-
ments submitted for our consideration shall be distributed in Spanish sufficiently far ahead of the
meetings.
    3. That care shall also be taken to supply us with interpreters on the occasion of such public de-
bates as the present.
(16) The PRESIDENT - I should like to say that if this point had been raised when the Drafting Com-
mittee was being constituted, I would certainly have included a member from the Spanish-speaking
areas. We all have the highest respect for Spanish culture and what it has achieved. I am glad
also to note that, in spite of the absence of a Spanish member, the draft resolution is being supported
by the representative of their culture. As for the documentation, the Secretariat will certainly take
note. I call upon the delegate of Switzerland.
(17) Mr. BOURGEOIS (Switzerland) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, ladies and
 gentlemen, I should like to say a few words in explanation of the draft resolution we are about to
submit to you. I shall be brief, for as Mr. Piaget told you yesterday, we take the view that the
interim measures the Executive Board has asked the Director-General to apply are not only incom-
 patible with the Constitution and with the Staff Regulations, but are also superfluous.
 (18) The Staff Regulations, if applied in a loyal and forthright manner, make it possible for the
Director-General to take full account of the wishes of all the delegations present at this Conference.
 That is why I ask for separate votes to be taken. There should be one vote on the draft resolution
 submitted by the Drafting Committee, which we are prepared to support, and another separately,
 on the draft that I should now like to read to you again: “The General Conference requests the
 Director-General to suspend until further decision of the General Conference the application of the
 interim measures not contemplated by the Constitution of Unesco and by the Staff Regulations. ”
 (19) Mr. SALOMON (United States of America) - On behalf of my Government, I want to compliment
 the Drafting Committee on their action in bringing forth an agreement that proved acceptable to the
 vast majority of the Drafting Committee. A fine attitude of co-operation was manifest which is
 typical of the spirit of Unesco. while the document does not represent wholly what we would have
 preferred, I would say that the United States delegation agrees to it and hopes that it can be voted
 on promptly so that we can proceed with the other business before this short session.
 (20) Mr. HAGUIWARA (Japan) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, fellow delegates, I
 am delighted to learn that the Drafting Committee has produced a compromise which may prove sa-
 tisfactory to all the delegations. The Japanese delegation will vote for this draft resolution, with
 one comment, one reservation, which I would ask you, Mr. President, to have included in the Re-
 cords.
 (21) I do not wish to deal with the substantive question of the duties of an international official; I
  see no need to dwell on that point, for I think I have made my attitude sufficiently clear at the meet-
 ings of the Executive Board. I should like to speak on a point rather similar to that raised by the
 Italian delegate at yesterday’s meeting, regarding the position of those countries which are Members
 of Unesco but not of the United Nations. As you are well aware, some fifteen of the Member States
 of this Organization are not Members of the United Nations. They are Austria, Cambodia, Ceylon,
 the German Federal Republic, Hungary, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Laos, Libya, Monaco, Nepal, Spain,
 Switzerland and Viet-Nam. Without counting Hungary, which has to all intents and purposes ceased
 to co-operate with us, there therefore remain about fifteen Member States of this Organization -
 about a quarter of our total active membership - which are not Members of the United Nations. Ob-
  viously these countries will not all wish to be bound by a decision taken by an Organization to which
 they do not belong. Unesco’s relationship with the United Nations is clearly defined in Article X of
  the Constitution of Unesco, quoted yesterday by the Indian delegate, which says that “This Organi-
  zation shall be brought into relation with the United Nations Organization, as soon as practicable,
  as one of the Specialized Agencies referred to in Article 57 of the Charter of the United Nations.
  This relationship shall be effected through an agreement with the United Nations Organization under
  Article 63 of the Charter.” That agreement exists, and contains a definite stipulation regarding
  co-operation between these two Organizations in questions of personnel policy. The stipulation is
  embodied in Article XIII, quoted only yesterday by the delegate of the United States of America,
  which says that the United Nations and Unesco recognize that the eventual development of a single
  unified international civil service is desirable from the standpoint of effective administrative
                                                          - 63 -

 co-ordination, and that with this end in view, common personnel standards, methods and arrange-
 ments should be developed to avoid serious discrepancies in terms and conditions of employment,
 to avoid competition in recruitment of personnel, and to facilitate interchange of personnel in order
 to obtain the maximum benefit from their services. The Article goes on to say that the United
 Nations and Unesco “agree to co-operate to the fullest extent possible in achieving these ends and
 in particular they agree to” - I quote here from paragraph (b) - “consult together concerning . . .
 matters relating to the employment of their officers and staff, including conditions of service . . D
 with a view to securing as much uniformity in these matters as shall be found practicable”.
 (22) It seems to me that the draft resolution now before us says much the same things as Article
 XIII of the existing Agreement between the two Organizations, and if this draft resolution is adopted
 I hope it will not be interpreted in such a way as to increase Unesco’s commitments to the United
 Nations. It is with that reservation, and on that understanding that this resolution does not increase
 Unesco’s commitments to the United Nations, that the Japanese delegation will support it.
 (23) Mr. ZURAYK (Syria) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, I do not wish to lengthen the dis-
 cussion unduly or to present any formal amendment, but I would like to make a brief declaration.
 In the mind of the Syrian delegation, we would have liked to have the fourth paragraph read, instead
 of the phrase: “will be in accord with.. ", the phrase: ‘ . . . will be worked out in agreement
 with ...", because in the mind of the Syrian delegation at least, the best policy should be the result
 of consultation and agreement between Unesco and the United Nations and other Specialized Agencies,
 and there should be no implication at all that Unesco will follow a policy already made by the United
 Nations and the other Specialized Agencies. With this reservation, the Syrian delegation will vote
 for the resolution.
 (24) Mr. STANKOVIC (Yugoslavia) - (Translation from the French) I have the honour to inform
 you that the delegation of Yugoslavia supports the proposal of the Swiss delegation, and considers
 that the Conference should take a decision thereon.
  (25) Mr. DAOUD AMMOUN (Lebanon) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, gentlemen,
  in a text of this importance even the smallest details count, and I agree with the French delegation
 that in the French text of this resolution the word “reserve” should be written without an “s” in the
 phrase “sous réserve des dispositions”. That word should be in the singular and not in the plural,
 otherwise the meaning may be altered. That is all I wanted to say.
 (26) The PRESIDENT - We have first to vote on the Swiss amendment supported by Yugoslavia.
     (A delegate asked if this was a separate draft resolution or an amendment.)
 (27) The PRESIDENT - We will take this up later. I now put to you the main resolution on item 15,
 without the amendment. Those in favour? Those against ? The resolution is carried without oppo-
 sition.
 APPLICATION TO UNESCO OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
 DATED 9 JANUARY 1953
  (28) The PRESIDENT - We now come to the draft resolution presented by the delegation of Switzer-
 land and seconded by the delegation of Yugoslavia. It relates to item 12 on our agenda. Any discus-
  sion? Those in favour of the draft resolution? Those against? 28 against, 12 for, and 12 absten-
 tions. The motion is rejected. I call upon the delegate of France.
  (29) Mr. JUVIGNY (France) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, the French delegation
 would like to explain its decision to abstain from voting. This decision was based on the document
  put before us under 2 XC/7 Addendum 2. In that document, the Executive Board announces its in-
 tention of extending the interim measures, subject to reconsideration by the Board at its Thirty-
  sixth Session. We hold that in the present circumstances it will be, or should have been, for the
  Board to reconsider the question of these interim measures, more especially in the light of action
 that may be taken by other authorities, and here I am thinking of the decisions that may be adopted
  by the Assembly of the United Nations. In view of the Swiss proposal and of the fact that the pro-
  ceedings were being conducted too rapidly to give us time to speak in support of this standpoint
  beforehand, we were obliged to abstain from voting.

 (30) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) - (Translation from the French) Just one word, Mr. President. The
 highest hopes are permissible, after the joy we have all felt at achieving unanimity on a motion
 which we had at first regarded as surrounded by so many difficulties. As the Swiss proposal has
 been rejected by a large majority, I should merely like to express a wish, which may or may not
 find support, Mr. President, but which I should like to have put on record. At the time when the
 Executive Board, faced with considerable internal difficulties, took the responsibility of proposing
 the interim measures with which you are familiar, it had had no opportunity of learning the views
 of the majority of delegations from the Member States which are attending this meeting. I think the
 Board, aware that it is in duty bound to reflect the opinion of the General Conference with the great-
 est possible accuracy, will voluntarily undertake to reconsider its interim recommendations in the
 light of the discussion which has taken place here, and I am sure we can rely upon it to show the
 greatest possible fidelity to the views expressed in the resolution we have unanimously adopted.
 (31) Mr. de ICAZA (Mexico) - (T ranslation from the Spanish) Mr. President, fellow delegates, I
 should like, after the event, to explain my reasons for voting in favour of the Swiss delegation’s
 motion. If I understood it correctly, that motion proposed the suspension of the interim measures
not contemplated by the Staff Regulations. The delegation of Mexico was in full agreement with this
proposal, inasmuch as the provisions now in force, and in particular Staff Regulations 9.1 and 10. 2
 can only be interpreted in the way in which the Acting Director-General has interpreted them.
 (32) Sir Ben Bowen THOMAS (United Kingdom) - I merely rise in order, if possible, to expedite
our business. Now that we have disposed of the general resolution that was so well redrafted for
us by the Drafting Committee, may I suggest that we now dispose, Mr. President, of item 12 on
our agenda, which we are now discussing, by receiving the papers 2 XC/7 with their annexes and
noting their contents. I beg to move to that effect.
(33) Mr. NOGUEIRA (Uruguay) - (Translation from the Spanish) I am particularly anxious to ex-
plain my abstention from voting on the Swiss motion. It was based on the same reasons as those
given by the delegate of France.
(34) The PRESIDENT - Those who are in favour of this motion on item 12 - that we receive the
papers and note the contents? Those against? Abstentions? The motion is accepted.
 REPORT OF THE ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL ON REGULATION 1.6 OF THE STAFF REGULATIONS
(35) The PRESIDENT - We pass on to item 13.               I call upon the Acting Director-General.
(36) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - Mr. President, document 2 XC/8 refers to the applica-
tion of Regulation 1. 6 of the Staff Regulations (Remuneration). I shall not take the time of the Con-
ference by going through the arguments set out. I think they are reasonably succinct and clear. I
might say that I found it difficult to administer this regulation at Unesco and I therefore commend
to you very strongly the draft resolution which is on page 2 of document 2 XC/8, paragraph 11.
(37) The PRESIDENT - On item 13 of the agenda the following is the draft resolution which we are
called upon to consider and approve:
   “The General Conference resolves
    To amend Regulation 1.6 to read as follows:
   ‘Except as hereinafter provided, no member of the Secretariat shall, during the period of his
    appointment, accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any government
    or from any other source external to the Organization. The Director-General may authorize such
    acceptance in respect of services rendered before appointment or for war service. He may au-
    thorize the acceptance of honours and prizes from educational, scientific or cultural organizations
    and the acceptance of remuneration for work done by a member of the Secretariat in his spare
    time provided that such work is not incompatible with his status as an international civil servant.“’
(38) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - Mr. President, I might say in explanation that the first
five lines of that regulation are substantially the same as now exist, and the change requested be-
gins in line 3 from the end with the words: ‘I., . and the acceptance of remuneration for work done
by a member of the Secretariat in his spare time provided that such work is not incompatible with
his status as an international civil servant. ”

    (39) The PRESIDENT - The delegate of the German Federal Republic moves the acceptance of the
    proposed change and the delegate of the United Kingdom seconds it. The resolution is adopted.
    CONSIDERATION OF COMMUNICATlONS RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNMENTS OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY
     (40) The PRESIDENT - We pass on to the communications received from the Governments of
    Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The first draft resolution relates to Czechoslovakia:
      “The General Conference,
        Having taken note of the communication addressed to the Acting Director-General by the Czecho-
        slovakian Ambassador in France, announcing, on the orders of his Government, Czechoslovakia’s
        decision to withdraw from the Organization;
        1. Declares that the allegations contained in the aforesaid communication are completely un-
        founded; and
        Considering that the Organization was set up to ensure the co-operation of all the nations of the
        world in the field of education, science and culture;
        Considering that the Member States of Unesco have, in consequence, recognized the universal
        character of the purposes and functions of the Organization. which has always faithfully observed
        the principle of universality in all its activities;
        2. Invites the Government of Czechoslovakia to reconsider its decision, and to resume its full
        collaboration in the Organization’s activities. ”
    Any remarks? Those in favour? Those against ? Abstentions? The resolution is adopted.
     (41) We have now the same resolution, with the substitution of “Hungary” for “Czechoslovakia”.
     Those in favour? Those against ? Abstentions? The resolution is adopted.
     (42) I would like to read to you the draft resolution submitted by the General Committee. The cir-
    culated document (2 XC/DR/G, rev.) has undergone certain changes.
       “The General Conference,
        Considering that the Organization has always observed the principle of universality in all its acti-
        vities; and
        Taking note of the resolutions adopted by the General Conference at its Seventh Session and its
        Second Extraordinary Session, concerning the communications received by the Organization from
        the Governments of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia;
        Invites the Director-General to forward these resolutions to the Secretary-General of the United
        Nations, with the request to bring them to the attention of the appropriate organs of the United
        Nations. ”
    (43) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) Mr. President, fellow dele-
     gates, the Spanish delegation is prepared to subscribe to the General Committee’s draft resolution,
    but would like to know why we should have recourse to the United Nations in order to make our
    wishes known to the countries concerned, because, as has already been said by some of our col-
    leagues who are not Members of the United Nations, we non-members do not understand how we can
    turn to the United Nations to transmit a resolution we have adopted. Would it not be better for the
    General Committee, or the Executive Board, or the Director-General, to communicate direct with
    the Governments which are being asked to reconsider their attitude, rather than choose a round-
    about way?
     (44) The PRESIDENT - Any other comments ? If not I will put the resolution as here circulated to
    the vote. The Spanish proposal was to send the resolution to the Governments directly and not to
    the United Nations. but this motion has not been seconded. It must be seconded before I can put it
    to the vote. I recognize that Lebanon supports the Spanish proposal. The Spanish proposal is that
    the phrase “Invites the Director-General to forward these resolutions to the Secretary-General of
    the United Nations” be omitted.
     (45) Mr. DAOUD AMMOUN (Lebanon) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, gentlemen,
    we are confronted by a question of procedure, and it is difficult to form a final opinion without
     having the text before us; but the Lebanese delegation supports the Spanish delegation because the
     latter is right with regard to one specific point; Hungary too is not, I believe, a Member of the Uni-
    ted Nations. So far as Hungary is concerned, therefore, it would hardly be possible for us to com-
     municate with the United Nations. On that point at least, the delegation of Spain is perfectly right
     in what it says.
     (46) The PRESIDENT - Are there any other speakers ?                The motion of the Spanish delegation,
                                                            - 66 -

 supported by Lebanon, is before you first. In view of the fact that certain countries mentioned that
 they were not Members of the United Nations, they felt the approach should be made directly to
 Governments, and not through the United Nations. The Spanish proposal will be read now.
 (47) Mr. MONTAGNIER (Secretary of the General Conference) - The suggestion is that the third
 paragraph should now run as follows:
   “Invites the Director-General to forward these resolutions to the Governments of these three
    countries, asking them to reconsider the question of their relations with Unesco. ”
 (48) The PRESIDENT - The particular measure inviting the Governments to reconsider their deci-
 sion has already been approved in the resolutions we have adopted. All that is now said is that the
 invitation to the United Nations be dropped. Those for the Spanish proposal that the invitation to
 the United Nations should be dropped? Those against ? Abstentions? The Spanish proposal is
 adopted by 26 for; 12 against; and 7 abstentions. I call upon the delegate of the United States of
 America.
 DISCUSSION ON THE UNITED STATES DRAFT RESOLUTION ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF MEMBER STATES FROM THE
 ORGANIZATION
 (49) Mr. PERKINS (United States of America) - I wish to thank you most heartily for having done
 me the very great honour of electing me to the Executive Board.
 (50) I should at this time, however, like to present a draft resolution to make it possible to take
 action on withdrawal at the General Conference, if we should want to do so at that time. With that
 in mind the United States delegation proposes the following resolution:
   “The General Conference requests the Director-General and the Executive Board to submit to
    Member States, in time for consideration at the Eighth Session, the necessary amendments to
    the Constitution to provide for withdrawal from membership in the Organization. ”
 (51) I should like to make a few comments that will clarify our reasons for offering this proposal.
 Unesco has adhered to the concept of universality of membership, and my Government has fully
 supported this concept and continues to do so. But it is to be regretted that any Member State,
having once subscribed to the Constitution of Unesco, should find it desirable to withdraw from the
Organization. It is even more difficult and unfortunate, it seems, that the withdrawal should be
 based upon the reasons set forth in the letters of withdrawal submitted by the States of Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The draft resolution before the Conference provides additional time
for these countries to consider the resumption of their relations with the Organization and the as-
 sumption of those responsibilities which all membership implies. At the same time, the General
Conference cannot indefinitely, it seems to us, maintain the fiction of membership States, which
have in fact withdrawn and which have ignored their responsibilities. They were firm in their de-
termination - in the case of Poland by taking no action on the resolution passed at the Seventh Ses-
 sion - to withdraw and have no further relationship with this Organization. Our amendment will
assure simply that the General Conference at its Eighth Session will have the opportunity to adjust
its operations to the situation that exists, since it will, by the terms of this draft resolution, be
able to consider an amendment to the Constitution providing for withdrawal.
b(52) There are several practical considerations that I am sure are obvious to you and that you have
in mind. They might be mentioned later if our proposal is adopted. Meanwhile we will be faced
with the necessity of making assessments against these Member States that have withdrawn. It is on
the basis of such assessments that we must estimate income for the next biennium. The Organiza-
tion cannot be in the very anomalous position for all time to come of continuing assessments against
Member States that have declared they are not Members. It would be really futile to make assess-
ments against such States when they have declared a year or more in advance that they were no
longer Members, the implication being that they had no further intention of contributing to the work
of the Organization. It is for those reasons that we submit this proposal.
(53) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) (Chairman of the Executive Board) - I should like to explain
the position of the Executive Board in this matter which it considered when it was examining the
communications from Hungary and Czechoslovakia. At its Thirty-fourth Session the Board studied
the legal position regarding the absence of any provision for withdrawal from the Constitution. There
were advantages in including such a provision but, on the other hand, the very close similarity
between the position of Unesco and that of the United Nations was considered. The United Nations
Charter does not make any such provision. The Conference for revision of the United Nations
Charter is planned for 1956. The Board thought that Unesco should await the outcome before
                                                        - 67 -

   proposing any change in its own Constitution in this respect. The Board therefore decided not to
   propose any amendment to the Constitution at present but is keeping the matter under review in the
   light of any developments in the United Nations.
   (54) Mr. MIGONE (Italy) - (Translation from the French) I wish to support this proposal. It would
   seem reasonable that if someone no longer wishes to belong to a club, he should be entitled to re-
   sign from it; of course one prefers that no such case should arise. I appreciate the highly ideal-
   istic view that was taken in foreseeing the possibility that a Member might leave us, but this is
   also a recognition of the freedom of decision of every Member. The Italian members of the Execu-
   tive Board supported this view before the Board, and I should like to make it clear that the Italian
   delegation is prepared to agree; on condition that a discussion is held regarding the manner of
   amending Unesco’s Constitution, a step which will be proposed in due time.
    (55) Mr. HAGUIWARA (Japan) - (Translation from the French) The Japanese delegation supports
   the United States proposal which has been seconded by the Italian delegation. As Sir Ronald Adam
   has said, this question was discussed by the Executive Board, but there was a minority which took
   the view that the question of revising the Constitution must be considered, and should continue to be
    considered. The reason given by Sir Ronald is that the Charter of the United Nations is to be re-
   vised in 1956 and that that Charter and the Constitution of Unesco must to a certain extent be kept
    in line with each other. There is undoubtedly something to be said for this; but at the same time
   we are well aware that most of the Specialized Agencies have a clause authorizing Members to
   withdraw from the Organization. All the organizations, though linked to the United Nations by a
    special agreement, have to retain their independence, and this similarity between the United Nations
   and Unesco should not be over-emphasized. This is, I think, the attitude of most States which, like
   ours, do not belong to the United Nations, and I need not remind you that it is not by our own wish
   that we are excluded from that Organization. Accordingly, without trying to carry the similarity
   too far, we should preserve in this Organization the essential basis of the Constitution. The draft
    resolution submitted by the United States delegation does not call for a revision of the Constitution;
    it suggests that the Director-General and the Executive Board should, without prejudging the
    question in any way whatever, continue to consider the possibility of amending the Constitution (or
    so it appears to me) and instructs them to pursue the study of the question. Those who disapprove
    of inserting provisions permitting withdrawal will certainly have an opportunity of discussing the
    matter at Montevideo, and I think it would be advisable to adopt the draft resolution submitted by
   the United States delegation.
    (56) Mr. CAIN (France) - (Translation from the French) Without wishing, as has previously been
    said, to exaggerate the parallelism between the procedure of Unesco and that of the United Nations,
   I should like to say that I agree with the reservations made just now by the Head of the United King-
    dom delegation. I feel that the motion submitted to us raises a very important problem, and one
    that few of us have studied thoroughly before coming to this Conference. I think the matter can be
    considered; the United Kingdom delegate suggested it could be studied by Unesco while it was also
    being studied by the United Nations. In any event, improvization would, it seems to me, be unde-
    sirable, and for that reason I shall not support the motion.
    (57) If you will allow me, I should like to add a few words. The last vote we took concerned a
    reference to the United Nations. As you will all have realized, that vote took place amid the great-
    est confusion. Indeed, some of us were not clear as to whether the case of Hungary was to be re-
    ferred to the United Nations or not, We were confronted by a draft resolution which did not seem
    to us to have been worded clearly enough. I consider that now we are about to conclude this Con-
    ference - for it is soon to be concluded, without preliminary studies - any improvization is unde-
    sirable. That is why I am in favour of what was said by Sir Ronald Adam.
    (58) The PRESIDENT - The proposal by the delegation of the United States of America is this:
      “The General Conference requests the Director-General and the Executive Board to submit to
       Member States, in time for consideration at the Eighth Session, the necessary amendments to
       the Constitution to provide for withdrawal from membership of the Organization. ”
    (59) Mr. de ICAZA (Mexico) - (Translation from the Spanish) Mr. President and fellow delegates,
    I feel obliged to make the strongest reservations regarding the form in which motions are being
    submitted to us and the manner in which we are voting on them. It is impossible to vote on amend-
    ments or motions unless they are clearly drafted in the three working languages and we are given
    sufficient time to study them. Notwithstanding this reservation, I should like to say here and now
    that if a vote is taken on the United States motion, the delegation of Mexico will vote against it, on
    the following grounds:
                                                           - 68 -

(60) The Mexican delegation takes the view that Unesco is a world-wide Organization, working on
a high spiritual level, and we therefore do not consider that the Constitution can legitimately con-
tain a clause legalizing the withdrawal of Members. The departure of any Member State should be
regarded as a simple question of fact, and we think that whenever anything of the kind occurs, it
should be made clear that Unesco would be interested and delighted to see the States concerned re-
suming their co-operation with the Organization at the earliest opportunity. The delegation of
Mexico even considers that any State which may withdraw should be kept regularly supplied with
Unesco publications, and thus be constantly informed as to the progress of the Organization’s work.
I thank you.
(61) Mr. DAOUD AMMOUN (Lebanon) -(Translation from the French) Mr. President and fellow dele-
gates, I shall be extremely brief. I think we should do well to adopt the suggestion made just now by
the delegate of France, because the mere fact of preparing an amendment of this kind in the present
state of international feeling may be regarded as being significant, If, at the present juncture, we
decided to consider methods of enabling certain Member States to withdraw, we shall appear to be
accelerating the procedure for such withdrawal. I am not suggesting that a State can be kept in this
Organization against its will, but I think it is more important - because, as was said just now,
Unesco has always maintained the concept of universality - to leave the door open for them. This
on the matter of principle.
(62) As for procedure, it must be admitted that an amendment to the Constitution of Unesco is
something rather important. We ought either to consider all the necessary amendments together,
or leave things as they are, so that we can return to the question later on and study it rather more
closely. The manner in which the present motion is expressed makes it possible, of course, from
the practical standpoint, to reach a solution on a point for which no provision is made in the Con-
stitution. We are well aware, however, that such a provision was deliberately omitted from the
Constitution. To provide at present for this change of principle, for this change of form, would be
to indicate a tendency which, at a time when the international spirit seems to be moving towards
conciliation, might be misinterpreted. The Lebanese delegation will therefore support the motion
of the delegate of France on this point.
(63) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) (Chairman of the Executive Board) - I should like to
make an explanation. I was not speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom. I was referring to what
happened at the Executive Board without taking any side whatever.
(64) Mr. DUPUY (Canada) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, fellow delegates, I
feel that we are almost all agreed on essentials. Two points must be borne in mind. We want to
know who are with us, and we hope that even those who are not represented at this Conference are
with us in heart and spirit. We also hope to be able to leave the door wide open to enable those who
 may so desire, unconnected, I may say, with any other Organization, to share in our work and
perhaps help to create that sense of spiritual and intellectual fellowship without which even the
greatest and most active organizations cannot find the inspiration which will keep them in life. The
door must therefore be left open. On the other hand, however, I feel that if I were the Director-
General of Unesco I should perhaps spend sleepless nights thinking about my budget and asking
 myself on whom I could count. It is all very well to say “I shall submit a balanced budget”, The
budget has to be drawn up in the ‘light of the funds actually available. This view of the question
 must also be considered, and I shall be glad if the motion we are about to vote enables the Secre-
tariat and the Executive Board to make constructive proposals to that end at our next meeting, at
 Montevideo, in order to facilitate the task of our Organization and ensure its continued existence
and its expansion.
 (65) Mr. PERKINS (United States of America) - I would simply like to point out that we are not de-
 ciding at this time whether or not these people who propose by their own motion to withdraw can do
 so. We are merely suggesting that we put ourselves in a position at the time of the Montevideo
Conference to adopt some method of withdrawal should we think it desirable.
 (66) I should also like to point out that we make it even more difficult for these countries to enter
 into the full participation that we all should like them to assume by continuing in our present ano-
 malous position; for if these countries, as sometimes happens, should desire to resume
their activity in Unesco, and we hope they will, they would be called upon to pay up their full
assessment.        That would be such a burden to them financially that in itself it might preclude
their taking part actively in our Organization. On the other hand, if they were to withdraw,
there is always an opportunity for them to return, and they will be heartily welcomed, I am
 sure, by all of us. It would be a more practical arrangement if we should decide at
                                                       - 69 -

    Montevideo to accept their withdrawal and recognize it simply as a matter of fact.
    (67) Mr. MIGONE (Italy) - (Translation from the French) I must confess I did not think we should
    be plunged into such arguments. I thought it was quite clearly proposed to study a question and not
    to settle it either in principle or in detail. The expression “open door” has been used; and of
    course the door must be left open, open to everybody, to those who wish to come in, to those who
    wish to go out, to those who wish to return. I would like to echo what the Canadian Ambassador has
    just said to us: all men of goodwill are and remain members of Unesco.
    (68) The PRESIDENT - We have had a proposal by Mexico and France that the matter be deferred
    until the draft resolution is circulated to the members of the Conference. That is also according
    to our Rules of Procedure. As a general rule no draft resolution can be discussed or put to the
    vote unless copies have been circulated in the working languages to all delegations not later than
    the day preceding the meeting. I should like to know whether the Conference agrees with the sug-
    gestion made by Mexico and France to defer this matter till tomorrow, by which time this resolu-
    tion will be distributed in the working languages. Those for deferring? Those against? It is your
    wish that the matter be deferred and the document circulated in the working languages.
    DISCUSSION ON A SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF MANKIND
    (69) The PRESIDENT - Professor Carneiro would like to make some observations on the Cultural
    and Scientific History of Mankind.
    (70) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) - (Translation from the French) I merely wish to put a few facts be-
    fore this Extraordinary Session of the General Conference. I am quite aware that the circumstances
    in which it was convened debar it from adopting measures outside the strict limits of its powers and
    competence. But under the system of biennial conferences, those who have been entrusted by the
    General Conference with any particular task have to take advantage of every extraordinary meeting
    in order to supply the Member States with the fullest possible information regarding the progress
    made.
    (71) I am merely the representative of this assembly in my office of Chairman of the International
    Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind. I shall continue to exercise that
    function so long as this assembly and the General Conference desire to maintain and preserve this
    Commission, which was established by Unesco, for Unesco. It is, therefore, neither as delegate
    of Brazil nor in my private capacity that I come before you with this report and warn you of a grave
    situation. I speak on your behalf, on behalf of this assembly, which during the last four or five
    years has adopted a series of resolutions relating to the establishment and development of an In-
    ternational Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind. It is in your name that
    I am speaking.
    (72) In the first place I should like to remind you that I have addressed a letter to the Director-
    General of Unesco, informing him that your hope of finding funds outside the ordinary budget of
    Unesco to meet the needs of the Commission during 1954 has not been fulfilled. I have approached
    the publishers you suggested, and various institutions whose names will certainly also have occur-
    red to you; but none of these sources has provided the sum of $30,000 which, as stated by the Com-
    mission, was deducted in the hope that special funds would be found elsewhere. I am not discussing
    the merits of the previous decision. I am simply pointing out that it was regarded by the General
    Conference itself as implying that an attempt would be made to raise funds from extra-budgetary
    sources. I should mention that, since our last meeting, the Journal of the Commission - which, as
    you know, is to be issued periodically and to summarize the original contributions, criticisms and
    commentaries received - has gone to press. Professor Lucien Febvre, the editor of this series,
    has already received enough paid contributions to fill about three issues. We have signed contracts
    with the publisher selected by the Commission. We have a world-wide network of contributors who
    are making surveys and carrying out research in accordance with contracts signed by the Com-
    mission. We have affiliated National Commissions in forty-two Member States. We have some
    twenty advisers in a number of States and in several ideological groups working in association with
    the Commission. The six responsible editors have been selected and are now at work, with signed
    contracts. The arrangements are: Volume I, Mrs. Jacquetta Hawkes and Professor Henry Frank-
    fort, United Kingdom; Volume II, Professor D. L. Pareti, Italy, with the assistance of Professor
    P. Brezzi; Volume III, Professor Wiet, France; Volume IV, Professor L. Gottschalk, United
    States; Volume V, Professor Jorge Basadre, Peru; Volume VI, Professor K. Zachariah, India.
    (73) The machinery has therefore been set in motion, with a whole team of scholars, historians,
                                                           - 70 -

National Committees and advisers. Are we to stop short on 1 January 1954? If this were a Gene-
ral Conference, I should put this question to you in budgetary terms; either the General Conference
must allocate the necessary funds for the Commission to continue its task, or the Commission
must abandon its task and the sum involved must be written off. This assembly is not in a position
to take such a decision and I cannot ask you to do so. What I do ask you is, in some way, to record
your wish that the Executive Board of Unesco, the only body which during the period between two
general conferences has authority to take decisions of this kind, should be invited to give very
careful consideration to the difficult situation of this Commission, which was set up by this as-
sembly, and to supply it before 1 January 1954 with the additional funds which, despite all its ef-
forts, it has not succeeded in obtaining elsewhere. I may add that I have gained the support of a
big American publishing house, which is prepared to conclude a contract with us for the six volumes
of the History (two of them in condensed form) and for any popular works on the subject that it may
be possible to issue in English. This firm is prepared to make us an advance of $30,000 in res-
pect of the whole body of publications entrusted to it. If that advance becomes payable as from
1954 - I do not want to trouble you on this occasion with points of detail regarding the Commission
- we shall receive it over a period of five years; so that for 1954 I can only count on an advance
of $7,500 which this big publishing firm is prepared to make to us. I am therefore asking you
whether you desire the Executive Board to consider the possibility of supplying us, from the budget
of Unesco, with the further sum of $20,000, without which the work you have set in motion, which
has already cost you $121,000 and for which you have approved a total expenditure of $400,000,
will inevitably come to a stop on 1 January 1954.
(74) Mr. CAIN (France) - (Translation from the French) I should like to say a few words in support
of Professor Carneiro’s proposal. He is the Chairman of a Commission whose task is to prepare
a History of Mankind; but Unesco too has its history - a long history already - and I should be
sorry if we were to give the impression that Unesco is withdrawing the proposals it approved at
various Conferences, in fact ever since that held in Mexico. This question has been on the agenda
every year since then. Successive general conferences have given their full approval to this
project. Thanks to a Commission composed of the most distinguished scholars it has been put
into operation and has taken clearer shape. It would be a disappointment, a disappointment to all
concerned, if this undertaking were to come to an end for lack of funds. As you have just been re-
minded, an act of faith was recorded during the last General Conference. The hope was expressed
of finding funds outside Unesco. I should therefore like to support Professor Carneiro’s proposal
and ask the Executive Board to make it possible for this task to be carried on until the Montevideo
Conference can consider the problem as a whole.
(75) Mr. VERNIERS (Belgium) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, my task has been
 made much easier by the fact that Mr. Julien Cain has just put forward all the arguments I intend-
 ed to use. This project goes back a fairly long time and I hope Mr. Cain will not be offended if I
 correct him on one small historical point. The idea of a cultural and scientific history of mankind
 goes even further back than the establishment of Unesco; the Conference of Allied Ministers, which
 met in London during the war, regarded the carrying out of the project as a most important task,
 as something essential which should be completed without delay.
 (76) This being so, I should like to express my warm support of the request made to you by Mr.
 Carneiro. He has taken exceptional pains to ensure the success of a project which has been diffi-
 cult to steer and has been exposed to the perils of both Scylla and Charybdis. We want to bring it
 safely into harbour. The machinery has been set in motion, as Mr. Carneiro said just now. We
 can hear it creaking slightly; but all it needs is a little oil in the wheels in the form of $20,000 or
 so.
 (77) Mgr MAROUN (Lebanon) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, as Chairman of the
 Programme Commission I should like to remind this assembly that at the last session of the Gene-
 ral Conference that Commission unanimously approved the project for a Scientific and Cultural
 History of Mankind. As Mr. Julien Cain and Mr. Verniers reminded us just now, it has been in-
 cluded in the programme of Unesco since the Mexico Conference, and it has known many vicissitudes
 but we are delighted that the first numbers of the “Journal” are now about to appear. That is why I
 wanted to remind you that the Programme Commission unanimously approved this project and its
 continuation during the last session. At the present moment the project for a Scientific and Cultural
 History of Mankind is hampered by insurmountable financial difficulties, and the suggestion made
 by the Chairman of the Commission is quite legitimate. It is that the Executive Board should be
 authorized to assist the Commission out of the ordinary funds of Unesco. I take great pleasure,
 therefore, in supporting Mr. Carneiro’s proposal.

   III-5                                       Plenary        Meetings
   (78) Mr. TOSCANO (Italy) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, fellow delegates, it is
   always unfortunate when a subject with a fairly long past history has to be discussed in a great
   hurry, and I should like to ask you for some further particulars. The question of the History of
   Mankind has given rise to lengthy debates during past conferences. The last conference decided to
   reduce the funds it had been intended to provide, on the strength of a hope which has not been ful-
   filled. We now find ourselves, as the Chairman of the Commission for a History of Mankind has
   pointed out, in a somewhat difficult position. and we have to discover a way out. The necessity of
   raising funds should not, however, lead us to make decisions likely to endanger a programme al-
   ready approved by the last General Conference. That is why, though I support Mr. Carneiro’s pro-
   posal, I should like to make one reservation. I would recommend the Executive Board to find a
   way of aiding the Commission in its task without prejudice to the implementation and completion of
   the programme approved by the last General Conference.
   (79) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - I think the Conference should be told the facts concern-
   ing the possibilities of help for this project. I would remind you that, in order to get the money,
   $30, 000 shall I say, which the History of Mankind project needs, the Director-General and the Ex-
   ecutive Board -would have to reduce the programme in some way in 1954. Or again, this Conference
   could say that the Director-General and the Executive Board should accord high priority on the basis
   of transfers or any possible surplus in this budget. I want, however, to remind you of the fact that
   the Working Capital Fund has been used, in accordance with the resolution of the Seventh Session of
   the General Conference, for emergency educational reconstruction aid in Korea to the extent of
   some $18,000 on the Working Capital Fund of the current year and some $18,000 on the Fund for
   the following year. The resolution which permits the use of the Working Capital Fund states very
   clearly that this may be done only if there is no possibility of transfer or surplus in the budgets of
   the years concerned. Accordingly, even if this Conference should give priority to the $30, 000 that
   we need in 1954 for the History of Mankind project, we would only be able, in the light of the reso-
   lution of the Seventh Session of this Conference, to get those $30,000 after we have saved $18,000
   which have already been devoted to the Korean project.
   (80) There is one other possibility that as an administrator I hesitate to mention, but since it exists,
   I shall indicate it to you and point out its advantages and disadvantages. This Conference is sove-
   reign and it could resolve to provide the required $30, 000 from the Working Capital Fund and ar-
   range for repayment when the budget for 1955-56 is established in Montevideo. I should like to in-
   for ril you, so far as I know, how the Working Capital Fund has been used in the past. The General
   Conference has been exceedingly strict, and to the best of my belief, it has recognized only two
   reasons for resorting to the Working Capital Fund. One of these is an emergency. But that does
   not mean an emergency in connexion with our programme but an emergency in the world, such as
   educational reconstruction in Korea, the outbreak of war and the like. The only other occasions on
   which this Fund has been used have been when it was impossible at the time for the General Confer-
   ence to indicate how much a project would cost. There is thus a possibility of authorizing recourse
   to the Working Capital Fund. You are well aware of the budgetary position of this Organization for
   these two years and I am sure you recognize that it may be difficult to find the money when the 1955
   and 1956 budgets are discussed in Montevideo. Such are the advantages and disadvantages of these
   possibilities.
   (81) What I might suggest is that the Chairman of the History of Mankind project and certain members
   of the Secretariat should get together in the course of the noon-hour, let us say, and see if they can
   prepare a draft for consideration later this afternoon. The Chairman of the Executive Board would
   certainly be with us in this type of discussion.
   (82) The PRESIDENT - I take it that you agree to the suggestion made by the Acting Director-
   General.
    DISCUSSION ON THE DRAFT RESOLUTION RELATING TO THE GANDHIAN WAY"
   (83) The PRESIDENT - We now take up item 14 - Consideration of the report of the seminar on the
   contribution of Gandhian outlook and techniques to the solution of tensions among and within nations
   (2 XC/9, Annexes 1 and 2). I call upon the delegate of India.
   (84) Mr. MUDALIAR (India) - Just before I entered Unesco House this morning a friend of mine
   said, referring to the possibility of this item being taken immediately after item 15, it is peace       .
   after a storm. I did not agree with him that there would be a storm, but I did agree that, SO far as
   the discussion on this particular item was concerned, there would certainly be a calm atmosphere.
                                                           - 72 -

                                           Plenary       Meetings                                       III-5
(85) I should first of all like, on behalf of the Indian delegation, to express my thanks to the Exe-
cutive Board and to this General Conference for including this item on the agenda, though the notice
was submitted rather late. My Government has deemed it desirable that this subject should be
brought to the attention of the Conference after the seminar held in India from 5 to 17 January, when
the distinguished representatives of several countries participated in the discussions. It was also
thought that the most appropriate forum for consideration of this seminar and its proceedings was
Unesco, because of the similarity of objectives. In the preamble to the Constitution of Unesco it
is stated, “That since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of
peace must be constructed. ” We believe that the Gandhian seminar and the Gandhian way of thinking
hold a definite place in the promulgation of the ideas of Unesco.
(86) Mr. President, in your opening remarks you expressed in your own inimitable way some of
the views of Mahatma Gandhi and you said how practical they were and how applicable to the present
world situation. I believe that, in view of the present tensions both national and international, of
the differences that are constantly arising between nation and nation and between groups of indivi-
duals within the nation and between individuals themselves, of the opposing interests of capitalism
and labour and of the clashing interests of race, creed, colour and even sex, there is a place for
the Gandhian outlook, which may contribute to composing these differences and reducing tension.
Mahatma Gandhi during his lifetime not only preached but put into practice every one of his teachings,
and in that respect he was perhaps a very different preacher from the many who preceded him, how-
ever great they were as saints and saviours. Mahatma Gandhi always felt that the practical reali-
ties of the world should be taken into consideration in the application of any of those principles. It
may be that, not realizing instantly what his objectives were, we may not always be able to appre-
ciate his viewpoint unless we carefully consider and study the methods that he adopted and the ideals
that he held. He always felt that the cause of the poor should be taken up in the interests of the
rich and that any principle that involved relieving the sufferings of the poor not only helped the poor,
but what is more important, helped the rich as well.
(87) “Beware the pine tree’s withered branch”, sang the poet Longfellow in “Excelsior”. We may
say “Beware the dire poverty of the poor ‘I, “Beware the awful avalanche”, that is, the terrible
strength of the great ones of this earth. These are the two great dangers Mahatma Gandhi saw to
peace in this world. The withered branch will fall on rich and poor alike and crush them both. The
awful avalanche will descend and bring destruction and devastation to many; but in the very process
of destruction and devastation it will destroy itself. The parallel is exact, and therefore Gandhi in
his way of life said that we should take note of the poor and of the rich, remembering that unless the
poor are saved and made to realize that they are as good as the others, there will be a danger to
the world. And remember also, he said, that if the strength of the rich and of the great is not mel-
lowed by work for their own countrymen and for the world at large, there will always be trouble.
Gandhi was not an Indian citizen, but a citizen of the world. For that reason we feel that the teach-
ings he has brought to the notice of the world should be considered by the world at large. He made
prison what it ought to be. When he was in prison he could have exclaimed: “Stone walls do not a
prison make, nor iron bars a cage.”
(88) This was absolutely true, not only for himself, but for many of his countrymen in times of
stress. I do not want to elaborate this point. All that I wish to say is that, in the teachings of
Mahatma Gandhi, we feel there is a message which the world needs at present, a message which it
needs more than at any other time, and in a world of conflict and tension there is something to be
said for the study of the Gandhian way of life which can probably ease this tension and bring relief
to the world. From this point of view, we suggest that Unesco should be the chief Organization for
promoting peace and goodwill and removing tension and should study this question and bring it be-
fore the nations of the whole world. In the belief that we shall be contributing something to peace,
to the relief of tension and to humanity at large, we bring this draft resolution to your notice.
(89) I have therefore much pleasure in proposing an amendment which has been suggested to the
original resolution submitted by the Government of India in the following terms:
  “The General Conference
   Decides to refer to the Executive Board and to the Director-General the report of the seminar on           -
   the contribution of Gandhian outlook and techniques to the solution of tensions within and among
   nations for study of the possibilities of implementation of the measures proposed by the Indian
   Government in the programmes for 1953-54 or in the draft programme for 1955-56. ”
(90) Sir Ben Bowen THONLAS (United Kingdom) - May I, on behalf of the United Kingdom delegation,
have the pleasure and the privilege of seconding this motion. We do so on several accounts. We
do so, in the first place, because it affords us pleasure to recognize the great interest and support
that the work of Unesco commands in India. In the second place, we do it because it represents to
us a very important aspect of our seminar work, namely, that the work once done in the seminars

 I I I - 5                                    Plenary       Meetings
  should be put at the disposal of a wider circle of people. Here in this valuable report we have the
  concentrated findings of the members of the seminar placed at the disposal of the members of this
 Conference and therefore desire that they should be more widely known. On the other hand. we are
 very well aware, after the discussion we have just heard on. the difficulties facing the Chairman of
 the Commission that is concerned with the History of Mankind, how difficult it will be, in the im-
  mediate future, at any rate, to find the resources to extend these possibilities. At the same time,
 we are glad there will be an opportunity, when the programme is considered at Montevideo, to see
  what the Executive Board can suggest as technical ways and means of making the findings of this
  seminar very much more widely known. For that reason, Mr. President, I have much pleasure in
  seconding the motion put before us by the Head of the Indian delegation.
  (91) Mr. COORNAERT (France) - (Translation from the French) Ladies and gentlemen, the French
  delegation would like to associate itself most warmly with the tribute paid to Gandhi, and is also glad
  to support the suggestion just made by a member of the United Kingdom delegation, that the tech-
  nical ways and means of acting on the proposal of the delegate of India should be referred to the
  General Conference which is to meet at Montevideo. Needless to say, all of us here recognize, in
  the name of Unesco, the admirable example set by Gandhi and the uplifting effect of his lifework on
  the great masses of the population in India and throughout the world. I feel, however, that before
  proceeding to practical action we should make a preliminary technical study, if only with a view to
  ensuring the further extension of this undertaking at a later stage.
  (92) Mr. LAVES (United States of America) - The delegation of the United States of America on
  behalf of whom I speak here would like to associate itself with the proposal that has been placed be-
  fore us so eloquently by the distinguished delegate of India. We have studied with great care the
  results of the seminar which has been held on the Gandhian way. We have been impressed by the
  possibilities of increasing the prospects for developing an honest understanding among the peoples
  of the world - that honest understanding which must be the foundation of a true and a lasting peace.
  We would like therefore to give our very strong support to the proposal on the question of how Unesco
  may avail itself of the precedent which has been set, and how it may best continue to work along
  these lines, and we agree that the Executive Board be asked, as the resolution suggests, to look
  into the possibilities of extending the seminar findings. Naturally, of course, Mr. President, as
  was said by the delegate of the United Kingdom, the problem of ways and means unfortunately arises
  even in respect to the best of projects, and we would assume therefore that it will be the first task
  of the Executive Board to consider the possibility of bring forward a proposal which could come up
  again at the Montevideo Conference, for implementation of this project.
   (93) Mr. CHOUKOUR WALI (Afghanistan - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, ladies
  and gentlemen, as delegate of Afghanistan I have had the opportunity of forming a high opinion of
  Gandhi’s work, especially his efforts on behalf of peace, and I hope the proposal of the delegate of
  India will be favourably considered.
   (94) Mgr MAROUN (Lebanon) - (Translation from the French) The delegation of Lebanon has re-
   ceived from its Government a cable instructing it to support the proposal of the delegate of India.
   and I should like to express my agreement with what Dr. Laves suggested just now, that in drawing
   up the programme for 1954-1956, the Executive Board should include in the agenda the proposal for
   a seminar on the Gandhian way of international peace.
   (95) Mr. AGUNG GDE AGUNG (Indonesia) - I think it unnecessary to restate the principles of the
   work done by Mahatma Gandhi, especially in India, and to describe the influence that that work has
   had in my country. Gandhi’s legacy to the Asian people, and especially to India and to Indonesia,
   is so great that I fully approve, on behalf of my Government, the proposal of the delegate of India
   in this matter. I therefore trust there will be strong support for this matter, so that we can
   continue the work of the seminar which was held during this year in Delhi, and I hope that the
   Executive Board will be able to establish a programme. The Montevideo Conference will provide
   an opportunity for drawing up a detailed programme to put before the General Conference and for
   thus meeting the wishes of the seminar at Delhi this year. For the Asian countries - and especial-
   ly my country - it is important that this work be continued and be recognized by this international
   organization, since Gandhi is not only an artist but the promulgator of a creed in the Asian peoples’
   struggle for independence.
   (96) Mr. NAKAYAMA (Japan) - It is unnecessary for me here to repeat the reasons for supporting
   the Indian proposal which have been so eloquently put forward by previous speakers or to dwell on
                                                           - 74 -

the many-sided influence of Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy throughout the world. I merely wish to
say on behalf of the Japanese delegation that I most warmly support the proposal.
(97) As a newcomer to a Unesco Conference, may I utter a word of criticism. 1 have been unable
to ascertain the names of the delegates and would have been glad to receive a complete list of the
members representing the various countries.
(58) Mr. PARRA-PEREZ (Venezuela) - (Translation from the Spanish) The delegation of Venezuela,
which is in entire agreement with the views expressed by various delegations regarding the proposal
of the delegation of India, has the pleasure and the honour of supporting that proposal, and hopes
that the Executive Board and the Director-General of Unesco will bear it in mind when drawing up
the work programme to be submitted to the General Conference at Montevideo.
(99) Mr. MASSAQUOI (Liberia) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, I should like first of all to
thank you for electing me to the Executive Board. I also thank those who, because of instructions
received from their Governments, could not vote for me but who in the end wished me success.
(100) I do not think that the discussion of the Gandhian way should be concluded without a word
from the representative of an old African Republic, because I think it was in Africa that Gandhi had
a dream and it was in Africa that he had an opportunity for the first time of applying this dream.
It is therefore a coincidence that on the very day and at the time when Unesco first elected an
African member on its Executive Board, the Gandhian way came up for discussion on the agenda of
the Conference. I give the proposal my full support and hope that the coincidence I have mentioned
will prove an augury of success for the Organization and the world at large.
(101) The PRESIDENT - The resolution is as follows:
  “The General Conference
   Decides to refer to the Executive Board and to the Director-General the report of the Seminar
   on the Contribution of Gandhian outlook and techniques to the solution of tensions within and
   among nations, for study of the possibilities of implementation of the measures proposed by
   the Indian Government in the draft programme for 1955-56. ”
   The resolution is adopted unanimously.

   GREETINGS      TO THE UNIVERSITY OF SALMANCA
   (1) The PRESIDENT - This morning, at the meeting of the General Committee, it was recalled
   that the University of Salamanca in Spain celebrates this year the 700th anniversary of its foundation.
   (2) Salamanca, ranking with the Universities of Oxford, Paris and Bologna among the most ancient
   and illustrious in the world as representatives of Western culture, is the source which has inspired
   scores of universities in the New World. It deserves to be recalled at this moment by the General
   Conference. It was in Salamanca that Columbus lectured on his discoveries and in its classrooms
   the Copernican system was first taught. Its civil and international law studies were for many years
   famous in Europe and attracted large numbers of teachers and students.
   (3) Such a commemoration cannot be overlooked by us and the General Committee has asked me to
   propose to you that we should request the Director -General to send to the University of Salamanca
   our greetings on this occasion and express the hope that it may long serve as a symbol of univer-
   sality and freedom of the human spirit in the world.
   DRAFT RESOLUTION SUBMITTED BY THE UNITED STATES DELEGATION ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF MEMBER STATES
   FROM THE ORGANIZATION
   (4) The PRESIDENT - The draft proposal presented by the delegation of the United States of America
   is now in the hands of the members in all three languages (2 XC/DR/8). The proposal reads:
     “The General Conference requests the Director-General and the Executive Board to submit to
      Member States, in time for consideration at the Eighth Session, the necessary amendments to the
      Constitution to provide for withdrawal from membership in the Organization”.
      Would you like to discuss the proposal today or defer it till tomorrow? We shall take it tomorrow.
   DISCUSSION ON THE REPORT OF THE HEADQUARTERS COMMITTEE
   (5) The PRESIDENT - We now come to the Headquarters question. Mr. Parra-Perez, of Venezuela,
   as the Chairman of the Committee, will speak.

from the French) Mr. President, gentlemen, the Headquarters Committee did me the honour of
appointing me its Chairman, and it is on behalf of the Committee that I now speak. For fear of
mistranslation I am going to address you in French; but I have another motive as well. The first
words I have to speak from this rostrurn are words of tribute to the French Government and the
Paris municipal authorities for their generosity to Unesco and for the spirit of harmonious goodwill
they have shown so markedly throughout negotiations which I will not call difficult, but which have
been very laborious. I am unable to convey to the French Government the thanks it deserves, but
I believe I am interpreting the feelings of the whole Conference by paying it a tribute, and I am
sure that the President will express these sentiments at the close of our discussion. There are
also various individuals to whom I think we should express our appreciation at the beginning of our
deliberations. I should first like to refer to our friend, Mr. Torres Bodet, one of whose dreams -
and I know this because he confided it to several of his friends, among whom I had the honour to
be included - was to see the Unesco Headquarters built and the installation of Unesco. Unfortunately
he was unable to realize his dream. Beside Mr. Torres Bodet I should like to pay a tribute to the
Acting Director-General, Dr. Taylor, who has earned Unesco’s gratitude for taking over the heavy
succession from Torres Bodet, and particularly for the successful negotiations he has conducted
over the building of a home for the Organization. Everyone on our Committee has worked with a
resolute will; I extend our thanks to them as well. But I should like to refer to the special part
played by Mr. Valeur, the French delegate on the Committee. He maintained the contacts between
the French authorities, the Committee and the Unesco administration, and displayed throughout
energy and intelligence, as well as outstanding and praiseworthy skill. I would also refer to the
share taken in our work, first, by my distinguished predecessor, Mr. Thomson, as Chairman of
the Committee, and by our Rapporteur, Mr. Gardner Davies, whose report I am going to lay before
you. Among the Secretariat, Mr. Montagnier and Mr. Leguen also deserve our gratitude for their
excellent work.
(7) Gentlemen, on behalf of the Headquarters Committee I have the honour to present to you two
reports. I shall not read them to you for they are somewhat lengthy, but they are before you. The
documents relating to every aspect of the Committee’s work have been circulated to you. At its
last two Ordinary Sessions the Conference was informed of the progress of this work, and docu-
ment 2 XC/3, dated 17 April 1953, was forwarded to the governments. This document contains
several annexes giving figures which you have been able to examine at leisure and the architects’
own opinion on the proposed building.
(8) In the Committee’s Supplementary Report, which is an addendum to that mentioned above, you
will find, as Annex I, the draft lease prepared in consultation with the French Government. In
Annex II there is also a document relating to the gifts and works of art which we all hope will
decorate our building. Lastly, Annex III contains suggestions relating to the execution of the Head-
quarters project, including the formation of a special office responsible for putting the work in hand
and seeing it through. As I have said, I will not stop to read these various documents to you; you
will have an opportunity to discuss them. I only wish to read out the Committee’s last resolution,
submitted to you as a draft. It reads as follows:
  “The General Conference,
   1. Authorizes the Director-General
       (a) To accept the offer of the site made by the French Government and to negotiate and exe-
            cute a lease relating thereto.
       (b) To accept the offer of a loan from the French Government and subject to any directions
            given by the General Conference to work out with the French authorities a schedule for
            advance and reimbursements and to negotiate and execute any necessary contracts
            relating thereto.
       (c) To proceed with the construction of the Permanent Headquarters of Unesco on the basis
            of the preliminary plan at a total cost not to exceed $6,000,000, this sum to include all
            irrecoverable expenditure made up to date and administrative and other costs.
       (d) To purchase, at a cost not to exceed $1, 080, 000, the additional equipment and material
            needed to put the building in working order.
       (e) To appoint Messrs. Breuer, Nervi and Zehrfuss as the architects to be entrusted with
            the work and to establish such services within the Secretariat as he may require.
   2. Authorizes the Director-General to establish, after consultation with the Headquarters Com-
       mittee, a Committee of Art Advisers to:
       (a) Prepare for the Director-General a general plan for the artistic decoration of the Head-
            quarters building, so as to ensure a harmonious integration of decorative elements in
            the architectural whole.
       (b) Submit to the Director-General the names of artists who might be commissioned to exe-
            cute works of art to occupy positions shown in this general plan, either with financial
                                                       - 77 -

  III-6                                         Plenary       Meetings
                contributions from certain Member States or within the budget provided for this item
                in the building estimates.
          (c) Examine all offers of works of art made by Member States or international organizations
                and make recommendations to the Director-General as to which offers it would be advi-
                sable to accept or decline.
      3. Authorizes the Director-General to ask Member States whether they wish to present the Or-
           ganization with building materials, furniture and supplies for the furnishings and decoration
          of the Permanent Headquarters, in accordance with the general plan established.
      4. Entrusts the Director-General in the light of such advice as he may seek in accordance with
          the terms of the present resolution with the responsibility of accepting or declining all such
          offers.
      5. Decides that the Headquarters Committee shall be continued until the construction of the Per-
          manent Headquarters Building is completed, to assist the Director-General in an advisory
          capacity. The Headquarters Committee is authorized to convene and consult with the Inter-
          national Panel of Five Architects if and when it deems necessary.
      6. Requests the Director-General to make a progress report to the Eighth Ordinary Session of
          the General Conference. ”
   (9) That is the draft resolution which the Headquarters Committee instructs me to submit for your
   consideration. You are requested to study it attentively and to adopt it with such amendments or
  additions as you may see fit.
  (10) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - I am not going to take up the time of the Conference by
  thanking all the people concerned who need thanking. You will recall that, on the day when the
  Conference opened, I indicated my sentiments concerning the building and expressed my thanks to
  the French Government. I certainly cannot allow this opportunity to pass without telling you that,
  in my opinion, the Headquarters Committee has been certainly as hard working a Committee as I
  have ever had to do with during my time at Unesco. They really need thanking. There is one small
  point that I would call to your attention that could arise in connexion with the draft resolution. The
  draft resolution has just been read to you by the Chairman of the Headquarters Committee. You
  will note that in document 2 XC/3, Addendum 1, page 3, sub-paragraph 3 of the draft resolution
  “Authorizes the Director-General to proceed with the construction of the Permanent Headquarters”,
  and so on. Out of an abundance of caution, and because we have very excellent legal counsel here,
  I must make this point. The lease which the French Government is giving us is such a generous
  one that it calls for a slight change in their law. Hence, the lease must be ratified by the Assemblee
  Nationale. That will, as you know, take time because you cannot ring up Parliament and say, “Please
  pass this law for me tomorrow”. Now the French Government has indicated to us that they will give
  us written assurances that, in the case of the remote possibility that the lease is not ratified before
  we have to start building and spend money on this building, they would return to us and reimburse
  Unesco. I want you to realize that all the small points have been thought out, and the French Gov-
  ernment has agreed to give satisfaction on everything. I can only say one other thing, I sincerely
  hope you pass this resolution so that Unesco can have its permanent home in Paris.
  (11) Mr. VALEUR (France) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, my task has been
  made very easy by the words just spoken by Mr. Parra-Perez, Chairman of the Committee, and
  by the Acting Director-General about the steps taken by the French Government to enable the Sec-
  retariat and the Headquarters Committee to present concrete proposals today for the construction
  of Unesco’s permanent Headquarters in Paris. I should like to mention that, at the Seventh Session
  of the General Conference, the French delegation, in the name of the French Government, under-
  took certain formal engagements connected with the decision to build the Headquarters in Paris. I
  can now inform you - or rather confirm to you, seeing that Mr. Parra-Perez and the Acting
  Director-General have already informed you - that the French Government has scrupulously car-
  ried out all its engagements.
  (12) The first was to put the site in the Place de Fontenoy at the disposal of Unesco. I may say it
  is one of the finest in Paris in the magnificent setting of the Ecole Militaire. I would remind you
  that this site had previously been accepted by the Sixth Session of the General Conference; it is at
  present occupied by army buildings. Here you will allow me to pay a tribute to the army, even in
  presence of this pacific assembly, for as you know it is not always easy to obtain concessions from
  the army for civilian purposes. The army, however, understood the importance of our request and
  co-operated in the common task with laudable zeal. The removal of their military installations has
  already begun and will be completed by 1 October. At that date the Ministry for Reconstruction -
  in this context I had better call it the Ministry for Destruction - will undertake at its own expense
  the demolition of the buildings on the site. The demolition will be completed and the site entirely
                                                          - 78 -

                                             Plenary       Meetings                                     III-6
cleared by 1 January, the date on which Unesco, with its distinguished architects, can begin the
first work of levelling the ground for the building. With reference to the very pertinent remark
made by the Acting Director-General about the possibility that the French Parliament may still
not have ratified the Headquarters Agreement and the lease annexed to it before 1 January, I can
give you a formal assurance on behalf of my Government that we shall give Unesco all the necessary
guarantees against the risks entailed by deciding to begin building before ratification of the agree-
ment, though such risks seem to me completely illusory. The French Government would not have
gone to the lengths it has in its engagements if it had not been reasonably certain that in the end
Parliament would ratify the Headquarters Agreement and the lease, which necessitates certain
amendments in the French law on long leases.
(13) The French Government’s other engagement related to the loan we are making to Unesco to
enable it to construct its Headquarters. We have given a general undertaking to grant Unesco a
loan covering total building costs. As the ceiling fixed for these costs by the General Conference
at its Seventh Session was $6, 000, 000 - that is, 2, 100, 000, 000 francs at the present rate of ex-
change, the French Parliament last December voted this sum to enable us to meet our obligation
in this respect.
(14) In the meantime the Secretariat has asked us for an additional guarantee of 400, 000, 000 francs,
that is $1, 080, 000 to equip the building. The French Government thought that these equipment costs
could be treated as building costs and that our undertaking to grant Unesco a loan covering building
costs should therefore apply to equipment costs also. France will thus lend Unesco 2,100,000,000
francs, repayable in thirty annual instalments, for the construction of its Headquarters and, in
addition, 400,000,000 francs repayable in twenty annual instalments for equipment expenses.
(15) Further, I would mention that Unesco has pointed out that, before it is completely installed
in the new Headquarters, it will be difficult to make the double payment of rent for the Hate1
Majestic where it is now housed, and the first annual sum repayable on the loan from the French
Government. The latter has therefore agreed that these first repayments shall not begin until the
year that the Unesco services are installed in the new Headquarters, that is to say, the first re-
payments will only begin in 1957. The sum of ZOO, 000, 000 francs, representing the portion
required for the work during 1953, is now at Unesco’s disposal. I hesitate to use commercial
terms before a highly cultural assembly, but frankly I think the non-academic expression that the
loan is not bad business for Unesco is permissible on this occasion.
(16) I would also like to mention that, in agreement with the Headquarters Committee, we have
asked the Ministry for Reconstruction to have the architects’ estimates checked by qualified mem-
bers of its building department. The results of this investigation are very reassuring, as the
Ministry experts consider that it would doubtless be possible to construct Unesco House for a sum
appreciably below 2, 100,000, 000 francs. This is in no way a criticism of the architects, who were
quite right to allow themselves a margin of safety.
(17) The third engagement undertaken by the French Government relates to reimbursing Unesco
for the costs of the second preliminary plan, as it has not been possible to carry this out because
the French Government, after giving Unesco permission to build on the Porte Dauphine site, with-
drew its offer of this site. It is therefore right that the French Government should reimburse this
sum to Unesco. It has not yet done so because we have not yet received the exact figure for the
expenditure, but I reiterate here, on behalf of the French Government, our undertaking to make
this repayment to Unesco.
(18) Our fourth undertaking was to remove all restrictions normally imposed on buildings in the
architectural setting designed by Gabriel for the Ecole Militaire. In this regard I must pay a
tribute alike to the commissioned architects, to the Panel of Five International Architects, and to
the appropriate French Government Departments, that is, the Ministry for Reconstruction, the
Seine Prefecture and the Directors of the Department of Fine Arts, for reaching agreement on the
type of architecture to use on this site. The only request made by the Sites Commission, as well
as the Directorate of Architecture, is that the architects should study the Conference building
further with a view to making it more imposing.
(19) In the circumstances, Mr. President, the French delegation, the French Government and,
I make so bold as to say, the whole French people await your vote with complete confidence. This
vote will enable Unesco to be installed in a building worthy of it, worthy of its services and worthy
of its competent and conscientious staff. Moreover, the construction in the heart of Paris, in one
of its most beautiful districts, of a handsome building to house Unesco is an act of faith in the
future of our Organization.
(20) The PRESIDENT - I call upon Mr. Gropius, Chairman of the International Panel of Five
Architects.
(21) Mr. GROPIUS, Chairman of the International Panel of Five Architects. Mr. President, under
                                                       - 79 -

  III-6                                         Plenary       Meetings
  the date of 23 March 1953, the International Panel of Five Architects placed their report on the new
  Headquarters building at Place de Fontenoy with the Unesco Headquarters Committee after a series
  of fruitful working meetings with the architects. This our report sums up as follows with these
  words: “Intelligent and imaginative town planning and a balanced architectural design have provided
  a solution which not only meets the requirements of Unesco but is also a worthy expression of modern
  architecture. It is indeed an achievement”.
  (22) These words characterize our opinion as professional advisers about the project in its present
  phase of preliminary design. We feel honoured that the Headquarters Committee, in its report of
   17 April 1953, under No. 2 propose to keep our services after this first preliminary phase has
  been concluded. The Panel advisers would gladly accept this further assignment as advisers and
  will clarify later the scope of their responsibilities.
  (23) Mr. JOCHAMOWITZ (Peru) - (Translation from the French)                       Mr. President, delegates, for
  the same reasons as Mr. Parra-Perez I also wish to speak in French, although it is easier for me
  to speak in my own language, Spanish.
  (24) Until last year I had the honour of taking part in the work of the Headquarters Committee as
  its Vice-Chairman. After the Seventh Session of the Conference I could not continue, as Peru was
  no longer a member of the Committee, but I still followed its work very closely and took a very
  great interest in it for various reasons. I did so, first, because of my profession: I am an engin-
  eer and I am greatly interested in architecture and actively concerned in it in my country. I there-
  fore felt in close touch with the work of this Committee. Moreover, I have always considered that
  Unesco’s future headquarters will be of enormous importance to it. This is a decisive step of the
  greatest moment to the future of our Organization. I wish accordingly today to express my very
  great appreciation of the work of the Headquarters Committee and to pay a tribute in particular, to
  Mr. Thomson, its Chairman until last year, and to Mr. Parra-Perez, who has had the honour of
   guiding its heavy task to a successful conclusion. The word “heavy ” is not strong enough, for this
   Committee has had to overcome numerous difficulties and to solve problems of every sort: techni-
   cal problems, legal problems and the problems of selecting people and of interpretation. I do not
  think any Committee has ever had a more complex and difficult task. That is why I whole-heartedly
   congratulate it and believe it deserves the Organization’s warmest thanks.
   (25) We have before us the results of its work in the form of several draft resolutions. I have
   carefully studied them and I am going to make some observations which, I should mention in ad-
   vance, are unimportant: they are formal matters, but it is in the hope of seeing this document
   perfect that I come to this rostrum to make them.
   (26) First, in the principal draft resolution, which is the authorization given to the Director-Gen-
   eral, page 3 of document 2 XC/3, Addendum 1, there is a paragraph conveying Unesco’s thanks to
   the French Government. I have already had occasion more than once to say how much we are
   indebted to the French Government for the immense service it is rendering us by giving us a site
   (and how magnificent a site!) and in granting us money for the construction of the building, repay-
   able in thirty years; it is a gift that has never before been made to any institution in the world.
   That is why, when the document says “Recalling the generous offer made by the French Govern-
   ment . . . ” I think the phrase inadequate. I suggest that it should at least say “the very generous
   offer . . . ” so as to emphasize that the gift made to us is tremendous.
   (27) Then, in the same document, paragraph 3 reads: “TO proceed with the construction of the
   Permanent Headquarters of Unesco on the basis of the preliminary plan . . ."’ etc. I cannot find a’
   categorical statement in this document saying that the preliminary plan prepared by the three
   architects, Messrs. Breuer, Nervi and Zehrfuss is approved. It says ” . . . the construction on
   the basis of the preliminary plan . . ..", which is completely vague. On this basis an entirely
   different building from that presented to us could be built. In addition, this preliminary plan is
   only one stage in the construction. A final plan must now be prepared, showing exactly what is to
   be produced. Obviously there are calculations to be worked out and building materials to be sel-
   ected; scale plans of the structure must be prepared and a mass of detail. I therefore propose
   that this clause be amended as follows: “TO approve the preliminary project for the Permanent
   Headquarters of Unesco presented by the three architects Messrs. Breuer, Nervi and Zehrfuss,
   and to adopt the final project and to proceed with the construction . . . “, and then the phrase: “at a
   total cost not to exceed $6, 000, 000, this sum to include . . .”
   (28) So much for the first draft-resolution. I now pass to the draft lease. In Article 5 there is a
   reference to the price which surprises me: “The present lease is agreed subject to the payment of
   a nominal annual rent of 1,000 francs, to be paid in advance on 1 January of each year to the Caisse
   du Receveur . . . ” I find the word “nominal” superfluous, even embarrassing. What does “nominal”
   mean? The exact meaning is “in name only without the real advantages”. This is not the case.
   There is a real rent; obviously it is a nominal rent if the figure of 1,000 francs a year is taken
                                                           - 80 -

                                              Plenary       Meetings                                      III-6
into account, but in a legal instrument the word “nominal” is superfluous, particularly as the draft
lease says, “authorizes the Director-General to accept the offer of the site made by the French
Government and to negotiate and execute a lease relating thereto”. Can one execute a lease with a
nominal rent ? I think not. I am not a lawyer, but I must say that I am surprised. I therefore
propose simply to delete the word “nominal”. The text will then read as follows: “The present
lease is agreed subject to the payment of an annual rent of 1,000 francs, to be paid . . . ”
(29) I accept all the rest, which is excellently drafted. The Committee has considered all the as-
pects and details of the question with the greatest care. It is a magnificent document.
(30) All the same, I should like to make a brief observation on Addendum 1, Annex III, which
concerns the establishment of an office to ensure that the building be completed according to
schedule and within the financial limits. The annex proposes that it should be known as the Head-
quarters Office. It seems to me that this title is too vague. “Office” is a somewhat abstract term
and the title should bear some relation to the work it has to do. I therefore propose that it should
be called the “Headquarters Building Office”. The office will be extremely important, and its
Director, who will be known as the “Building Director” or “Director of the Technical Office” or
“Project Director” will be entirely responsible for the building to Unesco, as the text shows, which
is as it should be. I feel, however, that this responsibility - indispensable though it is - needs               -
some supervision.
(31) In No. 6 of the draft resolution, the Director-General is requested to make a progress report,
on the basis of the project itself, to the Eighth Ordinary Session of the General Conference; but it
seems to me that since the Executive Board is the principal organ of Unesco and should be kept
informed of all the activities of the Organization, it also should be able to follow closely what the
Building Office is doing. For this reason I propose that the membership of the Office should include,
in addition to the personnel proposed on page 14 of this document, in Addendum 1, a representative
of the Executive Board enjoying the full confidence of the Organization and capable, in view of the
purely technical character of all the work of the Unesco Headquarters Building Office, of forming
an opinion on technical questions.
 (32) Mr. SALAT (Germany) - (Translation from the French) I should like first of all to associate
myself, on behalf of the German Federal Government, with the tributes paid by previous speakers
to the Headquarters Committee. Since Germany is a neighbour of France we have had the oppor-
tunity of following, not only by means of documents but through people who have taken part in it,
the excellent work accomplished in the past year by the Headquarters Committee. We agree with-
out any reservation to the findings that have been put before us.
 (33) In the second place, I should like to express the hope that we shall soon receive precise in-
formation about the conditions in which governments that are members of Unesco can offer gifts to
 the Organization, either by equipping a room or an office or by presenting works of art. My Gov-
 ernment asks nothing better than to associate itself in this common task. My reason for asking to
 speak is, however, a psychological one. There are some things that are entirely natural and
 reasonable and one of these is that the Headquarters of Unesco should be in France, and in Paris.
On solemn occasions things which are natural and go without saying are sometimes none the less
 pleasurable to speak about. Maternal love is natural, but a child is none the less glad to be able to
 tell his mother of the gratitude he feels. I therefore wish, on behalf of the German Federal Gov-
 ernment, to thank France and the people of France for their generous gift, and to associate my
 Government at this moment with the general tribute that has been paid to France. In our opinion,
 there is only one city which could be the Headquarters of Unesco; it is Paris, the heart of France,
 of Europe and of the world.
 (34) Mrs. HEFFELFINGER (United States of America) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, it
 gives me great satisfaction to be able to speak here, not only because I speak for my Government,
 but also because it makes it possible to ensure that at least one woman has spoken from this plat-
 form during the Second Extraordinary Session of the General Conference.
 (35) The discussion in which we are now engaged is a particularly pleasant one, since it concerns
 the last act required to give Unesco the permanence we have all sought. In London, in 1945, when
 Unesco had no home, it was France, through its great leader Leon Blum - to whose memory I wish
 to pay a tribute - that extended to us the hospitality not only of this great land but also of this very
 beautiful and friendly city of Paris, so long the intellectual citadel of liberty and culture.
 (36) Throughout these first difficult years, Unesco secured its place in the lives of free people.
  Paris has provided inspiration not only for all of us in the General Conference, but also for the
 Secretariat in its daily labours. The hospitality of the French Government has enabled the roots of
  this Organization to take hold throughout the world. It is again because of the generosity of the
  French Government that at last a permanent home has been found in a new and inspiring structure
 which will become a world symbol of the values and aims for which Unesco stands.

     III-6                                         Plenary      Meetings
     (37) It is with these deep sentiments of appreciation and friendship for France and faith in Unesco
     that the United States delegation wishes to be included among those who support this resolution.
      (38) We recognize the careful efforts which have been made to check the accuracy of the estimates
     and other figures which have been presented to us. Obviously no one of us can commit our govern-
      ments to an unknown higher expenditure. Nor do we wish a situation to arise in which Unesco might
      make a further call on the generosity of the French Government, which has been so repeatedly
      demonstrated. We presume that the completion of full working drawings will make possible more
     precise cost estimates. Should they exceed the figures mentioned in this resolution, it is expected
     that suitable action will be taken to keep the cost within the sum of $6,000,000, plus $1,080,000,
      or a total of $7,080, 000.
      (39) Although this is not the time to discuss future budgets, I think it well to observe that the bud-
      get for the years 1955 and 1956 would be the logical occasion to absorb some of the impact of the
      building costs. This is possible because the 1954 appropriation for Part I of the budget can be
      substantially reduced as a result of the fact that there will be no General Conference in 1955 and
     probably a Conference at Headquarters in 1956. Since, however, the French Government has
      generously offered to obtain deferment of the loan repayment until 1957, the Executive Board
      might give consideration to the desirability of establishing a building reserve fund in the 1955-1956
     budget, to which would be allocated the savings made possible by the reduction of Conference costs
      in 1955 and 1956.
      (40) Again may I be permitted to repeat the gratification the United States delegation has in heartily
      supporting this resolution. May this structure symbolize the conscience of mankind.
      (41) Mr. VERNIERS (Belgium) - (Translation from the French) The Belgian delegation would like
      to associate itself whole-heartedly with everything that has been said at this rostrum on the draft
      resolution we are discussing. When we came to examine the projects submitted to us, we felt in
      the Department of Education, to which I belong, that it was essential to obtain the opinion of
      qualified people. We therefore went to a great Belgian architect, a Director of the Brussels
      Higher National School of Architecture and the Decorative Arts and the creator of a building
      inaugurated barely two or three weeks ago. It is something that obviously does not resemble the
      permanent Headquarters of Unesco: the Ostend Casino. Those of you who visit Ostend can satisfy
      yourselves from the Digue or by entering the premises that the Casino is an admirable architect-
      ural work. However, I do not want to go on singing the praises of this building, I simply want to
      tell you that the architect to whom we went is a highly qualified and experienced man who knows
      personally all the great architects who collaborated in preparing the project now submitted to us.
      We also asked Mr. Stynen to look carefully at the estimates, so that we could be sure that Unesco’s
      dollars would not be wasted and that the French Government’s generous offer and its big loan would
      be used to good purpose. If you will allow me, I shall read you an extract from the letter we
      received in reply to our request.
      (42) “I consider”, Mr. Stynen says, “the preliminary plan submitted for the approval of the
      Member States to be excellent, no less for its proposed solution of the town planning problem than
      from the architectural point of view. The architecture, in my opinion, reflects the spirit of Unesco
      and answers its needs: I regard the solution put forward for the separation of pedestrian and motor
      traffic to be of vital importance”. We who risk our lives every day coming to Unesco will certainly
      appreciate this point. The layout of the Secretariat buildings is perfect and ensures that the lighting
      and the insolation will be of the best. The plenary meeting hall constitutes a solution in extraordi-
      narily good taste, its lines are wonderfully pure and its construction precise and perfect. The pre-
      liminary plan can be regarded as a first-rate piece of work andworthy of its object. At the same
      time, an examination of the acoustics of the main rooms is indispensable, as is also investigation
      into the acoustic isolation of the offices, their air conditioning and their artificial lighting. I
      personally should like to stress the air conditioning, for I have often suffered in this building, where
      I have been a frequest visitor for a long time, from the insufficiency of the air conditioning, and
      you are also suffering at this moment as much as I am. I will resume my quotation with a refer-
      ence to the estimates: “The unit prices, cited in the rough estimate of building costs transmitted
      in Addendum 1 of document 2 XC/2 are almost the same as those ruling in Belgium”. These prices
      are not unduly high having regard to the quality of the work proposed. You can therefore have an
      absolutely easy conscience when we propose, on behalf of the Belgian Government, the adoption of
      the draft resolution before us.
      (43) At the same time, Mr. President, I hope I shall be allowed to say that, after having myself
      carefully examined the text of the draft resolution, I should like, while associating myself with the
      amendments suggested by the delegate of Peru, to propose a slight modification, a good deal less
      important than that put forward by my Peruvian colleague. It is a question of a small formal modi-
      fication on page 4 of document 2 XC/3, Addendum 1, paragraph 5, which reads as follows: “Decides
                                                             - 82 -

                                              Plenary       Meetings                                    III-6
that the Headquarters Committee shall be continued until the construction of the Permanent
Headquarters building is completed, etc. ” I propose to substitute: “Decides that the Headquarters
Committee shall be continued until the permanent Headquarters building has been completed and
handed over to the Organization . . ."
(44) I should like to bring up another question, without attaching any very special weight to it. In
Addendum 1, page 14, we are given a list of the posts contemplated for the Headquarters Office,
which our Peruvian colleague quite reasonably proposes to call the “Technical Office” or “Perm-
anent Unesco Headquarters Building Office”. I wonder, and I put my question in no acrimonious
spirit, whether it is necessary to have an Assistant Director alongside the Project Director. I
simply raise the question; perhaps someone will be good enough to answer it.
(45) I shall conclude, Mr. President, like those of my colleagues who have already spoken, by
proposing the enthusiastic adoption of the plan before us. As Mr. Valeur said just now, and as the
United States delegate repeated, it constitutes an act of faith in Unesco. France, in making her
generous gesture, has shown her confidence in the future of Unesco, and the Belgian delegation
entirely and cordially associates itself with this confidence.
(46) Mr. ANDREWS (Union of South Africa) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, I am sure,
taking into account the very lengthy document that is before us, that we are all deeply indebted to
the Chairman of the Committee for the explanatory statement which he made in amplification of the
report itself.      This has been a very hurried session, and naturally so. It has been a business
session, and we have not really had the time for deliberation and consideration which some of these
matters warrant, particularly the one before us. On that account, I would repeat, I, for my part,
and my delegation, are deeply indebted to the Chairman of the Committee for the explanatory state-
ment introducing this draft resolution. Like my colleagues who have preceded me, I would too,
once again - as my delegation has done before - express to the French Government our deep ap-
preciation of its very generous offer and of the very easy terms which it has advanced to our
Organization.
(47) On another point I would endorse the view of our United States colleague, who expressed the
firm hope that the total cost of the building would not exceed $6,000, 000. That is a sum which all
along we have insisted should be the ceiling of the building. But my remarks, Mr. President, are
 related not so much to paragraph 3 of the General Conference resolution in document 2 XC/3 Add-
endum 1, page 3; they are directed to paragraph 4, page 3, of the same document, which author-
izes the Director-General “To purchase, at a cost not to exceed $1, 080, 000, the additional equip-
ment and material needed to put the building in working order. ” We all know that additional equip-
 ment and material are needed for the building, apart from the building itself. Indeed, that consi-
 deration has been taken into account in previous reports. But we have never known precisely what
 that estimate would amount to. Had this resolution come before us without that item in it in rela-
tion to that very large amount, more than one-sixth of the capital cost of the building, my delega-
tion would have known how to proceed on the basis of its instructions. However, in the short space
 of time in which we have had this report before us, we have had no opportunity - and I wonder
 whether any other delegation in this Conference has had the opportunity - of consulting our Govern-
 ment (and that means consulting the Treasury) as to whether this sum is acceptable from the point
 of view of voting it at this Extraordinary Session. I would therefore suggest - there may be tech-
 nical difficulties - that this is a particular matter that might very reasonably be considered at our
 next session at Montevideo. It would give us time to get details of this particular estimate of
 $1,080,000, and would give our governments time to contemplate the authorization or to offer such
 comments as they wished. My suggestion would therefore be to this Conference, as a constructive
 suggestion, that perhaps we could omit consideration of this particular paragraph in the resolution.
 If however, sir, for technical reasons it is necessary to authorize this amount here and now, then
 I must state in all frankness that my delegation would have to reserve its position in relation to the
 resolution as a whole.
 (48) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) Mr. President, fellow
 delegates, as the latest arrival in this House and one who is not very familiar with the details of the
 construction of the projected new building, I should like to ask for certain particulars rather than
 to raise any objections to the draft resolution now before us.
 (49) In the first place, I should like to express once again, on behalf of the Spanish delegation, our
 very special gratitude to France for its generous contribution to the success of an undertaking on
 which we have long been engaged, and our congratulations to the Committee which has carried out
 the preparations for this work with such painstaking attention to detail.
 (50) I speak rather from the point of view of the man in the street, for I am not a technician and
 have no special legal knowledge. I do, however, read most carefully the documents submitted to
                                                        - 83 -

      us, and I should like, as I already said, not to raise objections but to make certain requests reg-
      arding some points of the proposal that has been put before us.
      (51) Section 1 states that the total estimates amount to $6, 054, 000, thus exceeding the original
      estimate by $54,000, but that it is believed that economies can be effected and that it will conse-
      quently not be necessary to exceed the original ceiling figure of $6, 000, 000. My white hair and
      my many years’ experience of life and building have led me to the conviction that economies are
      never effected in estimates of construction, but that, on the contrary, further expenses are always
      incurred. We are all happy and eager about the projected Headquarters building. But we all make
      certain mental reservations regarding the problem of expenditure though perhaps they remain
      latent in this moment of happiness. We can hardly deny the usefulness and desirability of the
      building. Governments which, like my own, are short of foreign currency have to be prudent and
      very careful not to undertake commitments they may be unable to meet later on. If my memory
      serves me Mrs. Heffelfinger - and I take this opportunity to welcome the presence of a woman on
      the United States delegation - made a vague allusion to the future generosity of the French Govern-
      ment, suggesting that if we found our commitments too heavy that Government would even go
      beyond its present generosity and would allow us a longer period for payment. We ought to know,
      however, what lies ahead of us, and if the sum of $6, 000,000 is to be allocated proportionally
      among us, the proportion should be established for all the various countries, SO that delegations
      may have an opportunity of expressing their agreement.
      (52) I will now take the various points of the resolution one by one. The establishment of a Head-
      quarters Office, to supervise the contractor as it were, seems to me a very judicious measure;
      but one of the paragraphs - which I will not quote since you have all read it - suggests that with a
      contractor the expenses always exceed the estimates, whereas with the aid of this Office, and
      thanks to its vigilance, that will not happen here. In my opinion exactly the contrary is true: the
      only practical way of ensuring that the expenses will not exceed the specified amount is to agree on
      a definite sum with a contractor. I am not opposing the establishment of the Office, but it is only
      to be expected that this Office will lead to fresh expenditure rather than to economies, since it will
      find that the colour is not pleasing or that the ventilation is unsatisfactory, or it will find fault with
      the work that is going on. When a building is erected for a fixed sum the result is different. I
      should like to mention as an example the Brazilian Treasury Building, which is one of the glories
      of Rio de Janeiro and, perhaps, of the whole world. When it was planned, an estimate was sub-
      mitted, and the Minister of that day said: “For me, it can be five times as big, but I don’t want to
      hear more about it until the work is finished”. It was completed as he had ordered without any
      increase in cost, because no alterations were made afterwards.
      (53) I should like to assure France once again of our gratitude for its generosity in relieving US of
      the double burden of paying rent for this building and the amortization charges until 1 January 1957.
      I think, however, that the generosity would have been more complete - I apologize for stressing
      this - if the moratorium had been extended until our entry into possession of the new building. The
      date fixed for entry is 1 January 1957, but that is a myth, an illusion, a dream. We do not know
      whether the building will be finished by then; the period may prove insufficient. If the date on which
      repayment is to begin could be left open and arranged to fit in with the conclusion of our lease here,
      that would be fairer and more practical for Unesco.
      (54) The following paragraph says: “Considering that the French Government has undertaken to
      grant permanently to Unesco the privileges and immunities necessary for the exercise of its functions
      and to grant to it the right to acquire free of all taxes and duties all necessary material, equipment
      and services in France and also to import necessary equipment and material free of duty”. This
      paragraph, however, is in clear contradiction to page 11 of the Addendum, Annex III, which says:
      “In this connexion the question arises” - we were previously told it had been settled, but now we
      find it mentioned here - “of obtaining exoneration from customs and other duties on materials
      obtained abroad and exoneration from taxes on materials purchased in France. ” In other words,
      the draft resolution states that we have a definite promise of this, whereas the Annex says we are
      hoping to obtain it. I should like this matter to be cleared up too.
      (55) I now come to the most important point of the agreement. In actual fact, France is making us
      a gift; but from the legal standpoint it is not a gift but a lease. It is a lease at an insignificant rent,
      but a lease all the same. It is stated that this lease is to be granted for a period of 99 years, and
      will be automatically renewable, at the request of Unesco, for further successive periods of 99
      years. So why should it not be made an outright gift.,?Since it is in our power to renew the lease,
      its duration is in perpetuity, that is to say, not terminable: the site is ours.
      (56) In my opinion it would have been more logical (and here the French Government goes even
      further than my idea) for the French Government to have said “We will give the ground for the
      Unesco building, but if you want to use it for any other purpose, the ground and everything erected
      on it will come back to us, because it is not with that object that we are giving the site.” According
                                                             - 84 -

                                              Plenary      Meetings
to the present plan, if we do not put up the Unesco building we continue to own the ground, since it
is given to us in perpetuity, and that is not fair. The French Government is more generous and
says that if for one reason or another this ground is not used for Unesco, if you want to sell it or
if you want to recover what you have spent, the French Government will meet your expenditure and
take back the ground. That is more generous, but perhaps not so practical for us. In other words
I think the most practical thing would be simply to make a present of the site for building, in per-
petuity with no reservations, no favours and no conditions whatever.
(57) In Article 8 it is stated that “The present contract shall be submitted to the French Parliament
for approval at the same time as the Headquarters Agreement. ” 1 can quite understand that the
French Parliament has to ratify an agreement for the cession of part of the national patrimony;
what I do not understand is that it has to ratify the Headquarters Agreement, which relates to one
of our own offices and is an internal affair of Unesco. Perhaps the translation given to me does
not accurately render the meaning of the author of the resolution and of the plan in other languages.
(58) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) - (Translation from the French) The universal vocation of Paris
goes back a very long way, for the Romans already said: “Lutetia non urbs sed orbis’, and it is
because Unesco is as universal as Paris that the two became linked together and that its Head-
quarters was spontaneously set up here. The traditional largesse of the French monarchy has been
continued through the Republic, though it has changed its character; it is no longer bestowed to
rear a Palace of Versailles but to build the international Palace of Culture. We are happy to see in
the permanence of this generosity that the great examples of the past are more living than ever.
The thanks of all the Member States have already been expressed here in the most cordial form.
Brazil could hardly fail, when such high praise is awarded, to associate itself with these States
most enthusiastically.
(59) Mr. President, I intend to make certain remarks on behalf of my Government concerning
points of detail, but I should like first to consider a general problem: it is the part played by
modern architecture in the solution of one of the most complicated technical and social problems
which have ever arisen. Thanks to an extraordinarily fertile harmony of views between five archi-
tects of international fame: Messrs. Gropius, Le Corbusier, Rogers, Markelius and Lucia Costa,
and three great architects specially commissioned to assist in designing and executing a noble work
of art, you have been able to admire an architectural achievement as characteristic and revealing
for the twentieth century as were, for their times, the great temples of Upper Egypt and the
Parthenon of Greece. I hail this effort of modern architecture and this contribution of the inter-
national congresses of modern architecture as a step forward that could not have been taken without
Unesco. The rôle of the architect today is an eminently social one, and it is for Unesco to provide
the opportunities for these workers of tomorrow, in a world which seems to be everywhere yielding
under our feet and which has almost everywhere a sense of stifling, to breathe and to live with the
dignity of the men of tomorrow. That will be a signal victory also for a great class of intellectual
workers who are too often forgotten and whose rôle will become increasingly important in that
structure of the future to which we are making our own contribution.
(60) These eight leaders of contemporary architecture have until now been able to work together
and to examine together the weaker points of detail and the general effect in its main lines. It seems
to me important, indeed essential, that this collaboration should continue during the further working
out of the plans that have been outlined up to the present and of the models that have been submitted.
It should be recognized as indispensable that the panel of five international architects, whose busi-
ness it is to play the rôle of constructive critics to the great architects, should be kept in being.
These five architects together, or at least represented by three of their number, should continue to
collaborate with the three eminent architects in the designs and detailed plans which will later be
submitted to the Headquarters Committee and to the Director-General.
(61) There is at least one felicitous innovation in the Unesco Headquarters project. It is the estab-
lishment of a committee of art advisers which will assist the Director-General in incorporating the
plastic arts in this great architectural monument. We are happy to see that provision has been made
for a body which will include a representative of the panel of five, a representative of the group of
three, and artists and art critics. I cannot but think of the creation by Unesco at Venice of the
International Association of Plastic Arts, and I already see a means by which it can participate in
this great and completely new work. Hitherto, plastic art has tended to be dissociated from the
monument it decorates. Accordingly, when you visit the majority of the great monuments of today
you have a feeling of repugnance on looking at the faded panels and the statues that have no affinity
with the building. For the first time a real attempt is going to be made on a technical basis to
ensure that the work is in harmony with the age and that the structure as a whole will remain of
high artistic value throughout the centuries to come. In the plan submitted to us concerning the
functions of the committee of art advisers, there is, I feel, one point which is open to criticism; it
                                                        - 85 -

      is stated more than once that this group of advisers will submit its proposals to the Director-
      General. I do not ask for a modification of the text; all I suggest is what might be called a perf-
      ectly clear gentleman’s agreement with the administration of Unesco: an agreement that the op-
      inions expressed by this group of advisers will be transmitted not only to the Director-General but
      also to the Headquarters Committee, which is the sole official representative of the General Con-
      ference for everything that concerns the work on this great building. The Headquarters Committee
      cannot be kept out of any matter whatsoever that concerns the building, because this Conference
      has entrusted it with the duty of watching over everything connected with it; and particularly under
      a system of biennial conferences Member States must be continuously in touch with all that is being
      done in connexion with a plan as important and as costly as this one.
      (62) I should like to recall our hope that ample accommodation will be provided in the projected
      building for housing the governmental delegations. It is not merely for the convenience of deleg-
      ations that offices should be set aside for their work; the problem is a much bigger one. Unesco’s
      policy itself will be strengthened by the daily presence of these delegates at the scene of their
      labours. By observing such a group of workers devoted to this task and by submitting to each of
      them the opinions, suggestions and proposals of the distant governments which provide the moral
      and material support for this institution, the latter will be able constantly to experience the vivi-
      fying influence of the governments and at the same time to lay before them day by day the fruits of
      their joint labours. I should therefore like to urge that in the details still to be examined, the ar-
      chitects should take the fullest account of the fact that sixty-five Member States of Unesco should
      one day be able to have their offices at the Headquarters of Unesco, even if this result can only be
      achieved gradually and as the practical possibilities of accommodation permit.
      (63) One point of detail, Mr. President. Provision is made in connexion with the building of the
      Headquarters and this Technical Building Office for a Project Director. I imagine the part he will
      play will be an extremely complicated one. As I see it, he will have to be first and foremost a
      liaison officer, concerned with the local means of construction and with everything that can be
      directly supplied, whether by industry or by trade. He will also have to be within reach of Paris
      for the completion of the Headquarters under the most satisfactory technical conditions. I should
      like this Project Director to be a great French technician in touch with all the problems that the
      City of Paris and France may present, and with all the facilities they may afford for the achieve-
      ment of this task.
      (64) I believe, Mr. President, that we shall certainly encounter difficulties today as regards the
      voting of the budget. As far as I am concerned, I should like to tell you that the Government of
      Brazil regards it as a duty implicit in the position which it is proud to hold in this Organization
      to shoulder all the expenditure necessary to ensure that the Unesco building shall be the building
      of the humanity of the future.
      (At this point the Chair was taken by His Excellency Pierre Dupuy (Canada))
      (65) Mr. DAOUD AMMOUN (Lebanon) - (T ranslation from the French) Will you allow me first of
      all to make a few brief observations, as a jurist, on the form and the substance of the contract
      before us today. Although the Supplementary Report of the Headquarters Committee states that the
      report is submitted to us for information, I imagine that the word “information” implies the possi-
      bility of discussion as well.
      (66) In the draft lease there is a point on which I should like to reply myself to the delegate of Peru:
      it is that which concerns the nominal annual rent. Obviously, it is a juridical clause, a formal
      clause in French law. You have got to take account of the fact that a site whose leasehold value is
      several millions of francs, perhaps even a milliard, is being leased for 1,000 francs only. The
      word nominal comes in here to explain that it is only to avoid infringement of a clause of French
      law which assumes that the State cannot alienate such property - I believe that this is the explana-
      tion in the present case - or for some other reason. In fact, the word nominal here is meant to
      explain in what follows the extreme lowness of the rent. From this point of view, then, the word
      nominal has a legal meaning and interpretation; I think it can be left in.
      (67) Coming now to the substance of the contract, I should like to submit to the Conference two
      observations which are of a somewhat technical nature; I apologize for embarking on this subject.
      For example, Article 6 states: “The Organization shall nevertheless be responsible for the payment
      of City, Police and Highway duties, and in particular for municipal charges . . . All the above con-
      ditions to be fulfilled in such a manner that the French Government may not be involved in any com-
      plaint, dispute or litigation relating to the aforesaid buildings. ” Here again, if you like, it is the
      lawyer in me that is brought up by the phrase: “All the above conditions to be fulfilled in such a
      manner that the French Government may not be involved. ” The sentence needs an addition and
      should read as follows: “that the French Government may not be involved in any complaint, dispute
                                                              - 86 -

  or litigation relating to the aforesaid buildings on the subject of the aforesaid charges and duties”.
  There is a close connexion between the two and it is not made plain in the contract.
  (68) With regard to Article 7, which is the arbitration clause, I should also like to make an obser-
  vation. Here is what the article says: “Should any dispute arise regarding the carrying out of any
  of the terms of the present lease, the French Government and the Organization undertake, if it
 cannot be settled by negotiation or any other arrangement agreeable to both parties, to refer the
 matter for decision to a Tribunal composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by the Director-
 General of the Organization, one by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the third chosen by the
 other two, or if they are unable to reach agreement, by the Chairman of the International Court
 of Justice”. Would not the French Government itself agree with me to strike out the parenthesis
 “if it cannot be settled by negotiation or any other arrangement agreeable to both parties”? If it
 is settled by negotiation, there is no further dispute. It often happens between two parties that
 they have some sort of difference; if it is settled by negotiation, the difference ceases to exist.
 What cannot be agreed to, however, is the phrase “or any other arrangement agreeable to both
 parties”; it is possible to resort to arbitration, of course, and that is provided for, but any other
 kind of settlement is out of the question in this particular case, since we are dealing with an inter-
 national organization which enjoys extra-territorial rights. It would therefore be better to strike
 out this phrase, which contributes absolutely nothing to the substance of the document.
 (69) Article 8, “Conditions of entry into force of this contract” is drafted as follows: “The present
 contract shall be submitted to the French Parliament for approval at the same time as the Head-
 quarters Agreement”. The French delegate told us just now what would happen in the extremely
 improbable event of the present contract not being ratified. In fact it will be, and I see no object
 in taking precautions; but it might perhaps be added that, in such a case; there is either an
 agreement between the parties or a provision for the settlement of such expenses as Unesco may
 have incurred in the interval.
 (70) Continuing on this juridical level, I should say that we have nothing at all to fear from the
 French State, which has just furnished us with an additional proof of its generosity, and Lebanon
 would like to add its modest voice to the chorus of thanks addressed to France for establishing
 Unesco in Paris; I have no need to repeat what other speakers have said and what I said myself
 last year at the Seventh Session of our Conference; what we have most to fear from - and on this
 point we have not yet had sufficient explanation - is what I might call internal complications. Will
 the City of Paris and the French State find it easy to come to an agreement? If we were dealing
 directly with the City of Paris and with the French State, things would be much simpler. But can
the French State answer for the City of Paris? May there not be surprises in store on this point?
It is on this subject that we could do with a few rather clearer explanations; for example, the
 things we have been reading in the press on the Sites Commission have not seemed to us suffici-
ently clear.
(71) Finally, and this is the last point on which I shall be asking for information, might it not
possibly be a good thing to enlarge the membership of the Headquarters Committee a little and to
add one or two members. Now or never is the time to take geographical distribution into account
and to give an opportunity for every part of the world, whether it be on the cultural plane or the
linguistic plane, to be represented. The Headquarters Committee is at present composed of ele-
ven members; I think that, with the addition of three members, it would possess a geographical
composition more in line with the objectives of Unesco. I apologize to the French delegation for
having begun in a critical vein and I hope Mr. Valeur is not repeating under his breath, with his
thoughts on us, those lines of Racine:
    “When I take arms for you may I in hope repose
      I shall not see your name counted among my foes”
(72) It would be difficult to add anything to all that the delegates here have said about France.
Speaking for myself, I cannot find terms, or even a new formula. Let France, however, be
assured here and now of the sincere thanks of the Lebanese Government and, associating myself
with what Mr. Carneiro said on this point just now, I wish to state that although we are not a rich
country, we are ready to shoulder our share of the burden for the fulfilment of a task which will
permit Unesco to give material form to its intellectual and moral aspirations.
(73) Mr. MIGONE (Italy) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
the Italian delegation would like to associate itself with the extremely warm thanks that are due to
the French Government for its generous, its very generous, offer of a site which is one of the best
in Paris and for the interest-free financing of its construction and equipment. A loan of two-and-
a-half milliard francs without interest and for thirty years represents a gift which would be
completely unexpected, did it not come from the French Government. The Italian delegation, which
has taken part in the extremely painstaking work of the Headquarters Committee, would like before
                                                       - 87 -

   anything else to recommend the adoption of the draft resolution before you. There is only one
   matter to which I should like to draw your attention; it is point 2 of the resolution which you will
   find on page 3 of document 2 XC/3, Addendum 1, in which the Director-General is authorized to
   consult a Committee of Art Advisers. The Italian delegation, as Mr. Carneiro has already em-
   phasized, would like this committee to include a representative of the International Association of
   Plastic Arts. It is hardly necessary for me to remind you of the importance and the rôle of this
   association, which rose from the lagoons of Venice under the aegis of Unesco and inspired by its
   ideals. This proposal is not intended as any sort of reflection on the great talents of the architects,
   to which generous tribute has already been paid by the speakers who preceded me and with whom I
   entirely associate myself.
   (74) In conclusion, I should like to stress how important we feel it to be that the Headquarters
   Committee should continue in office and should be kept informed of the progress of the project and
   of the work, as the sole body empowered to represent the General Conference in this matter.
   (75) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) The Acting Director-General will reply to
   some of the questions which have been asked.
   (76) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - I have attempted to keep note of all the comments made
   by the various speakers and I hope that I will be able to give satisfaction as far as questions are
   concerned, and to make some suggestions which might work the draft resolution out to the satis-
   faction of almost everyone. First, as regards the remarks made by Don Alberto Jochamowitz of
   Peru, I think the first point he made was that we had not quite properly expressed our gratitude
   to the French Government. I suspect he is quite right. I venture to say that the reason is that
   resolution 29. 1 of the Seventh Session of the General Conference expressed gratitude for that
   generosity and I feel certain that, without difficulty here, we can elaborate the section of the res-
   olution to his satisfaction. It would be a great pleasure, I am sure, to reinforce our thanks to the
   French Government for its generosity. It has been said on every score and I am sure it should be
   underscored in the resolution.
   (77) The second point I have noted which was made by the delegate of Peru relates to sub-para-
   graph 3 of Section 1 of the draft resolution. He suggests that we include the idea of accepting the
   preliminary plan which has been approved by the jury of five and he also indicated that he thought
   the authority to proceed with the elaboration of the final project should appear there. I am quite
   sure we can very easily insert the proper words to do that.
   (78) The point raised concerning the nominal rent in the lease form was, I think, referred to by
   one or two other speakers. I imagine, possibly in view of the comments that have been made,
   that Mr. Jochamowitz would not insist on that point. This, I think, we all understand is the term;
   I suspect the point is more legal than anything else and I think we need not dwell on it. I believe
   he is quite right about the title of the Headquarters Office. I recall we had long discussions in my
   office on what we should call it and many names were mentioned. Finally, we decided to call it the
   Headquarters Office. We can add a word or two, I am sure, which will more clearly define its
   function in a short title. We could call it the “Headquarters Planning Office” or “Technical
   Control”. I am quite certain however, that we shall be able to satisfy the delegate of Peru on
   that point.
   (79) Another point was made in that same connexion. It had to do with the relation of the Head-
   quarters Committee to the Executive Board. It appears to me that the Headquarters Committee
   is an organ directly established, and it stands directly in relation to and reports to the General
   Conference. It is an organ made up of representatives of Member States, and I rather think that
   the relationship should not be disturbed. I certainly do not in any way intend to imply that the
   Executive Board will be kept in the dark about what the Committee does; its reports certainly can
   be made available from time to time. I do not believe that I have missed any other point that the
   delegate of Peru made that called for reply. If I have, please do not hesitate to call my attention
   to it when I have finished.
   (80) I was particularly interested to hear the report from Mr. Verniers. He will be glad to know
   that the architects have been very much concerned, as have members of the Headquarters Com-
   mittee, with acoustics. We have all had difficulties; some of the rooms in this building are very
   difficult. But acoustics seem to be a science, if I may call it that, which has not quite completely
  been resolved. All I can say to you is that the architects have in mind getting the best advice they
   can on the acoustics, and you can feel sure that we will do all we can concerning that point. I am
   greatly pleased also to hear the report on the cost estimates. We have done some very careful
   checking by having various official figures turned in.
   (81) Mr. Verniers referred to sub-paragraph 5 of Section 2 of the resolution - on page 4 of docu-
   ment 2 XC/3 Addendum 1. He suggested that the Headquarters Committee should be continued
                                                          - 88 -

                                              Plenary       Meetings                                    III-6
until the construction of the permanent Headquarters building was completed and included the idea
until the building had been finally accepted. I think certainly we should insert that in the resolu-
tion. That would be the idea, I am sure, that was in the minds of all when this was read.
(82) Mr. Verniers also raised a small point concerning the necessity for an assistant director to
the project director in the Headquarters Planning Office. I would say that I believe there is no
one more interested than we are in avoiding unnecessary expenditure. This estimate of the Head-
quarters Planning Office is the best we can produce now. You may be sure that if the Director of
that Office does not need an assistant the assistant will never be appointed. Our present thinking
is that he should have an assistant; but, as I say, we do not consider anything in this vein as
absolutely final. We will proceed and hire just what we need and spend as little as we can.
(83) The Head of the delegation of the Union of South Africa raised a rather more difficult point,
shall I say, for me to reply to. As regards the $1, 080,000 proposed for equipment to the building
I do not believe that he received as far as I can tell here - nor did you - a detailed breakdown of
this sum. I can read to you, if you like, all the details, but I think it will not be necessary. What
I want to stress is that this money is not there to buy fine new desks and swivel chairs. We intend
to take all the old furniture we have from here. It is not intended to provide handsome, prosperous
looking furniture. It is on the other hand to provide, for example, for electric light installations
and for equipment in the library - shelving and the like. It is to provide for equipment in the
cafeteria that is contemplated in the building. More important than any of those things, it is to
provide for the telephone installation. Telephones are necessary and they cost money. If some
move were made to cut down or to delay the approval of this million odd dollars I would have to
insist that we at least authorize the purchase of telephone equipment and light fixture equipment,
or at least conduits. The fixtures, of course, could be left till later, until Montevideo. But if we
do not purchase telephone equipment, that is to say, if we wait until Montevideo, it cannot be
properly installed in the building.
(84) You can, of course, be sure that at Montevideo you will get the fullest report on costs of all
kinds. I have told the Headquarters Committee before, and I want to repeat it to you, that if you
authorize this building there are two items in the resolution that fix ceilings - one is $6, 000, 000
for the construction of the building itself and for all the plans and the architects’ drawings, etc. ;
the other is the so-called equipment item. If you authorize these, Unesco cannot spend a dime
more than that authorization. That money will not all have been spent by the time of the Monte-
video Conference in the fall of 1954. If, for example, there should be an enormous increase of
prices somewhere, or if there should be an upheaval, we should of course have to report that to
you. We have asked and have obtained the best advice we can get and we think we have not made
any errors in the estimates. But we also know that to estimate for a building of this kind so far
in advance is almost impossible. It seems to me that if we come to Montevideo and you have
already authorized this building with these two ceiling figures and if we find they will cost US
50,000 or 30,000 or 100,000 more, we shall tell you at that time. You will have the choice of
saying: we will pay that extra 50, 000 or we will not pay it. If you do not pay it you will have fewer
offices or you may even have half a floor less, because you will be able to instruct the Director-
General at that time to stay within the figure if that is what you want him to do. So if you get a
little less building, you get a little less building; but you have stayed within the commitment that
has been made as far as the governments are concerned.
(85) That really leads me on to some of the questions raised by the Count de Casa Rojas. He
asked, for example, how we know we are going to spend exactly so much when he makes reference
to the Headquarters Planning Unit. The Headquarters Planning Unit is there for that very purpose.
It will plan time schedules. It will certify the payment to every contractor and sub-contractor
and the expenditures cannot be made without the authorization from that Office and without a host
of counter-signatures and approvals of the architects concerned and the administration here. So
I feel that at all events, you can be satisfied that your money is not going to be overspent. You will
be placed in possession of the full facts at the Conference at Montevideo and you can make up your
mind. I recall very well, particularly because of where it came from - that is to say, in the dis-
cussion in the Administrative Commission in the Seventh Session of the General Conference - that
the delegate of Canada made a speech along much the same lines. He said in effect, “We want to
know how much the building is going to cost. We have had sufficient experience of buildings to
know that when you say $6,000,000, it might be $5,980,000, it might be $6,050,000, it might
even be $6, 150, 000”. He said “We would not be concerned about that. But what we want you to
know, Mr. Director-General, is that we are not talking about an $8, 000, 000 building or a
 $9, 000,000 building when we tell you we are talking about a $6, 000, 000 or a $7, 000, 000 building”.
I believe that we have to approach the question in that way with the knowledge that the ceilings
cannot be exceeded. They certainly will not and cannot be exceeded. You will have for building
exactly the amount of money this Conference wants to vote.

    (86) To take up another point or two, I believe the Count de Casa Rojas raised the question of
   freedom from Customs duties, and he contrasted one section in the lease with a section in the
   Headquarters Agreement. One said “We hope to obtain” and the other said “We obtained”. As I
   understand that, we have obtained this authority from the French Government and I can assure
   Count de Casa Rojas on that matter.
    (87) Of the points raised by Mr. Carneiro, Brazil, I think the first of real importance had to do
   with keeping the Headquarters Committee in touch with the committee on the decoration of the
   building - the Arts and Decorations Committee I should like to call it. That item was discussed
   at some length in the Headquarters Committee, and I think the result was that no member of this
   Decorations Committee was finally put on from the Headquarters Committee. It was felt that that
   should be a committee of technicians, so to speak, of artists and experts, and that the Headquar-
   ters Committee members, being representatives of governments would not have the same kind of
   status. We felt when we discussed the matter there - I am sure it is recorded in the minutes -
   that liaison should be maintained between the two committees. We even went so far as to suggest
   that the Chairman or his representative might attend meetings of the other committee. I feel
   certain that we can give Mr. Carneiro satisfaction on that point, because the papers could be ex-
   changed between the committees. The important thing, we felt, was not to double the difficulty
   by saying that not only did the Arts and Decorations Committee have to approve or recommend to
   the Director-General the acceptance of projects and the like or the acceptance of gifts, but if we
   added to it the Headquarters Committee machinery and had to obtain two recommendations or
   approvals, it would slow down the process enormously. It might even get to the point of being
   ridiculous. I feel certain we can give Mr. Carneiro satisfaction on the maintenance of liaison.
   (88) Another question raised by Mr. Carneiro was the relationship of the Panel of Five. I feel
   certain that the resolution, as it is now established, provides for consultation there, as needed,
   by the Headquarters Committee.
   (89) I must confess that, when Mr. Daoud Ammoun of Lebanon said “certain of my points may
   appear a little legalistic”, some of his points escaped me. With your permission, Mr. President,
   I shall therefore ask Mr. Saba here if he wants to speak on the very legal character of those points.
   I would, however, say one thing before Mr. Saba raises that point, and that is on his proposal that
   we add three additional States to the Headquarters Committee. I would remind the Conference that
   the Headquarters Committee is composed now of eleven Member States elected at the twenty-third
   plenary meeting of the Seventh Session of the General Conference. Those States are Australia,
   Belgium, Brazil, China, United States of America, France, India, Italy, Pakistan, United Kingdom
   and Venezuela. The Conference is, of course, free to add additional Member States to this Com-
   mittee.
   (90) Mr. SABA (Legal Adviser) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, ladies and
   gentlemen, the delegate of Lebanon raised three difficulties with regard to the draft lease.
   (91) The first of these concerns Article 6, which is entitled “Duties and Charges”. I can say that
   this article was introduced at the request of the Representative of the Domaines. Under the pro-
   visions of French legislation, the Administration des Domaines is liable for taxation. What the
   representative of the Domaines wanted was a special provision which should make it quite clear
  that since Unesco enjoys complete fiscal exemption in the matter of the land tax, this tax should
   not be demanded from the Administration des Domaines, and having regard to the very small and
   nominal figure of the rent, I think this request was entirely justified. Accordingly the clause was
   modified so as to indicate clearly that Unesco enjoys exemption from land tax under Article 15 of
   the Heaxquarters Agreement. It is a question here, as far as Unesco is concerned, purely and
   simply of recalling the provisions which exempt it. The lease therefore indicates in Article 6
   that the Organization is exempt from land tax, but is not exempt from municipal charges for
   services rendered (this is the exact repetition of Article 15), and the final paragraph can only be
  construed, in this context, as signifying that the French Government can obviously not be obliged
  to pay either the taxes and duties which the Organization does not owe, or those which it does owe
  for services rendered. In any case, if the addition of the word “tax” would make the text clearer,
  I do not think the French Government would have any objection,
   (92) The second difficulty raised by the delegate of Lebanon concerns the arbitration clause. I
  may perhaps point out that this clause is a formal clause which is to be found in every contract
  signed between governments, and even, I may say, between international organizations and gov-
  ernments. You will find this “formal clause” in the Headquarters Agreement with the French Gov-
  ernment and also, if my memory serves me, in the Agreement between the United Nations and the
  United States of America. The object is to say in as courteous a fashion as possible that the hypo-
  thesis of a difference is really a very unlikely one because every method of conciliation, indeed
  every possible method, will be utilized to settle it. It is this reference to conciliation and all
                                                          - 90 -

possible efforts to avoid arriving at the stage of arbitration that is contained in the parenthetical
phrase which the delegate of Lebanon wants to strike out. My feeling is that, in view of its formal
character, there should be no objection to its standing.
(93) With regard to the entry into force clause I believe - the French delegate will perhaps be able
to give you fuller information on this than I could - that the ownership of the site concerned has
been definitivelytransferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Consequently I do not believe there
will be any difficulties with the City of Paris, as the delegate of Lebanon seemed to fear. This
entry into force clause is nevertheless a necessity for the French Government: you are aware that
the land legislation in France, and in particular the legislation on long leases, is an altogether
peculiar kind of legislation, which so far as private leases is concerned - I am not talking of the
Government because in the case of Government leases of land the limitations are even stricter -
limits the lease to a period not exceeding 99 years, and for the Government to eighteen years. In
fact, what you are being given is a perpetual grant, since Unesco will only have to make the re-
quest and successive renewals on the same terms will be accorded.
(94) Again, there is a second derogation from French common law. According to the legislation
on long leases, buildings belong to the lessors on the expiry of the lease. There again, in order
to obtain the benefit of the exemption clauses which we owe to the generosity of the French Govern-
ment, it has been necessary to resort to the principle of parliamentary approval. The only diffi-
culty with regard to this entry into force condition was pointed out to you by the Acting Director-
General just now: it is obviously difficult to be certain, in view of the parliamentary vacation, that
the lease will be able definitively to enter into force on 1 January 1954. On this point the delegate
of France and the Acting Director-General have explained the procedure contemplated with a view
to guaranteeing Unesco against all risks.
(95) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - I hope that one attorney has satisfied another. I should
like now to complete my answers to questions by replying to the one raised by His Excellency Mr.
Migone concerning the recognition of the Association internationale des Arts plastiques in the
Decorations Committee. In the Advisory Committee, we had certainly discussed that representa-
tion and also the representation in the International Committee of Art Critics. I therefore think
that his delegation can have full satisfaction regarding our intentions in establishing the member-
ship of this Committee.
(96) Mr. VALEUR (France) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, I feel the Acting
Director-General and the Legal Adviser of Unesco have replied to almost all the questions which
have been raised at this rostrum. There are, however, three points which directly concern the
French Government and on which I should like to put its point of view before you.
(97) I wish to reply first of all to the concern expressed by the delegate of Lebanon as to whether
the French Government would be able to obtain the building permit, as we call it, in view of certain
objections which may have been raised by French departments. I would begin by making it clear
and by recalling and repeating that the undertaking was entered into by the French delegation and
the French Government at the time of the last General Conference and that the disabilities which
encumbered building in the Place de Fontenoy were lifted. This means that though it is true that
in accordance with normal procedure the appropriate departments were consulted - and I repeat
that these appropriate departments are the Ministry for Reconstruction, the Department of Fine
Arts and the City of Paris - even if these appropriate departments were to raise serious objections
to the architectural project which is before you, the French Government has the power to override
them. All the same, we are a democratic country, and so far as is possible we do not like to over-
ride the objections of the proper authorities, especially if they have public opinion behind them.
On this last point, I should like to draw your attention, particularly the attention of those of you
who have recently come to Paris, to the fact that the newspaper articles on the project you have
before you have been in general favourable. As far as the Ministry for Reconstruction is concerned,
it also is entirely favourable. The same is true of the Department of Fine Arts, which comes under
the Ministry of Education. The only body that has raised a few objections on matters of detail has
been the Sites Committee of the City of Paris, but these were easily surmounted by an agreement
between the architects of the City of Paris and our architects, both those of the international group
and the group who are doing the actual work. The only thing on which the Sites Committee insisted,
and this is an important matter, was the character of the Conference building, and I repeat what I
said to you a moment or two ago. As I am not a technician I will mention the formula on which the
architects of the City of Paris were able to reach agreement with our architects: the Sites Com-
mittee requested the architects to devote particular attention to the Conference building in its mon-
umental aspect. I believe our architects are entirely ready to re-examine in some degree this part
of the project.

 III-6                                         Plenary       Meetings
  (98) To take another point, the delegate of Spain talked of the question of exemption from taxes.
 I believe the Acting Director-General has been able to reassure him. I would simply like to add
 that a rough calculation has been made of the total amount of these tax reliefs and, as far as I know,
 it comes to about a million dollars. In consequence, these million dollars are to be added to the
  generous treatment - I do not want to have to stress this point too much - which the French Govern-
 ment has already shown to Unesco.
  (99) The delegate of Spain also raised the question why the French Government had not made an
  outright donation of the site rather than granting a lease of it. I will not repeat what the Legal
 Adviser said on this issue, since in reality the lease is a perpetual grant. I will quote from
 Article 2 of the Draft Lease: “At the request of the Organization, the lease shall be renewed on
  the same terms and the present contract extended for further successive periods of 99 years”.
  The result of that is that the French Government has not the option of refusing renewal of the lease:
  its renewal is automatic, on simple notification by Unesco.
  (100) I should simply like to point out to the delegate of Spain that certain difficulties of a juridical
  character arose. The first of these difficulties was explained by Unesco’s Legal Adviser: it was
  the fact that a French Government cannot grant a lease for a period longer than eighteen years, and
  that is why a parliamentary ratification is necessary. In regard to the question of donating a piece
  of State land, we come up against a provision of public law which it is much more difficult to get
  over than a provision of private law. Consequently, I appeal to the spirit of generosity that charac-
  terizes the Spanish people and I hope that the delegate of Spain will not maintain his objection.
  (101) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) I should like to obtain an
  explanation. You have been kind enough to take note of my observations, but there is one point to
  which no reply has been made. Article 8 says that “The present contract shall be submitted to the
  French Parliament for approval at the same time as the Headquarters Agreement”. I said that the
  approval of the French Parliament was indispensable for the charges, the lease and the amendment
  of the French law, but that the Headquarters Agreement was a private matter of our own and did
  not require the intervention of the French Parliament. This is the only point that has not been
  made clear to me, and I would ask the legal experts on the General Committee to be kind enough to
  explain to me why the French Parliament has to approve the establishment of our Headquarters.
  (102) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - Mr. President, the Convention referred to there is
  the Convention on Privileges and Immunities, the so-called Headquarters Agreement. But of
  course it must be ratified by the Parliament. We operate on a temporary agreement now.
  (103) The PRESIDENT (Translation from the French) Are there any further speakers? No? In
  that case, gentlemen, I think we can now deal with the various amendments which have been pro-
  posed. I will ask the Secretary to read you the first amendment, on which I will then consult you.
  (104) Mr. MONTAGNIER, Secretary of the General Conference, (Translated from the French)
  Mr. President, the delegate of Peru proposes to introduce the word “very” into the third paragraph
  of the preamble to the draft resolution to describe the generous offer made by the French Govern-
  ment: “Recalling the very generous offer made by the French Government”.
  (105) The second amendment also comes from the Peruvian delegation. It concerns No 3 of
  Section 1 of the draft resolution, and it would make the beginning of the paragraph read as follows:
    “3. To approve the preliminary project for the Permanent Headquarters of Unesco presented by
  the three architects, Messrs. Breuer, Nervi and Zehrfuss, to adopt the final project and to pro-
  ceed with the construction at a total cost . . .‘I (the remainder is unchanged) Agreed.
   (106) In Section 5 of the draft resolution, the Belgian delegation proposes to introduce the follow-
  ing amendment: “Decides that the Headquarters Committee shall be continued until the Permanent
  Headquarters Building has been completed and handed over to the Organization . . . ” (The remainder
  is unchanged. ) Agreed.
  APPOINTMENT OF ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO THE HEADQUARTERS COMMITTEE
  (107) Coming to the paragraph which deals with the Headquarters Committee, we have before us
  draft resolutions tabled by the Lebanese delegation concerning the composition of this committee.
   The Acting Director-General told us just now that the Headquarters Committee is at present com-
  posed of eleven members. The object of the Lebanese delegation’s motion is to increase the
   membership of the Headquarters Committee to fourteen. Here is the text of the motion: “The
  General Conference, in order to obtain a better geographical distribution in the membership of the
                                                          - 92 -

  Headquarters Committee, decides to increase to fourteen the number of its members”.               If this
  draft resolution is adopted by the Conference, it could form a new paragraph, No. 6.
(108) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Those in favour of this amendment?
  Against? The amendment is adopted by 27 votes to 12.
  (109) Has anyone any proposals to make on the subject of the three new States to be added to the
  Committee?
  (110) Mgr MAROUN (Lebanon) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, the Lebanese
  delegation proposes Greece as the twelfth country.
  (111) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) - Mr. President, in view of the very active part taken by the
  Canadian delegation in the discussions at the last session of the General Conference, I would like
  to propose Canada.
  (112) Mr. MASSAQUOI (Liberia) - Mr. President, I would like to propose the delegation of Spain
  as the fourteenth member.
  (113) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Are there any other proposals? In the
  absence of any further nominations, I will consult the Conference as to whether the first nomina-
  tion, that of Greece, is seconded and adopted.
     Adopted.
     The nomination of Canada?
     Adopted.
     The nomination of Spain?
     Adopted.
     I therefore declare Greece, Canada and Spain added to the list of countries represented.
  (114) Gentlemen, now that you have voted on the amendments, I will consult you on the resolution
  as a whole. I call upon the delegate of Spain.
  (115) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) I was so much pressed for
  time when speaking that I may perhaps not have made my meaning quite clear. We are told that in
  order to avoid a duplication of expenditure, repayments are not to begin until we give up the lease
  of this building and are therefore postponed until 1957. I suggested that instead of fixing a date, it
  would have been better to say, until we enter into possession of the new building. This might be
  before or after 1957. In that way we would bring into line the spirit and the letter of the agree-
  ment, for the intention is that we shall not have to pay for two buildings at the same time. Thus,
  if the new building were finished before 1957, repayment would begin sooner, while if it were
  finished only later, this clause would come into force, stipulating repayment not in 1957, but as
  from the date on which we enter into possession of the new building.
  (116) Mr. MIGONE (Italy) - (Translation from the French) If I have understood aright, the Head-
  quarters Committee is now composed of fourteen members. I should like to propose that it be
  composed of an odd number. I therefore suggest that the membership be increased to fifteen and
  I propose that the representative of Denmark be invited to join the Committee.
  (117) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Gentlemen, the delegate of Italy proposes
  that one more country be added to the list of the countries represented and suggests that this
  country be Denmark. All those in favour of this proposal? I call upon the delegate of Mexico.
  (118) Mr. de ICAZA (Mexico) - (Translation from the Spanish) Mr. President, I suggest that the
  motion we are discussing should be divided into two parts: the first part, relating to the increase
  of the membership to a total of fifteen, that is to say an odd number, seems to me to be excellent.
  I am in favour of it and shall vote for it.
  (119) As for the second part, despite all our esteem and respect for the delegation of Denmark, I
  feel obliged to call the attention of the Conference to the question of geographical representation:
  if there are to be fifteen members I think the fifteenth member should be a representative of Latin
  America, nominated by general agreement of the Latin American delegates to this Extraordinary
  Session. Thank you.
  (120) Mr. NIELSEN (Denmark) - It was the general view of my delegation that the number of the
  members of the Committee should not be increased. It is our view that a small body is capable of
                                                          - 93 -

  doing more efficient work than a large one. We accordingly voted against increasing the number
  of the Committee. Now Denmark has been proposed as a member. I would therefore ask that the
  name of my country be omitted and that you agree on another member.
  (121) Mr. MUDALIAR (India) - I must confess to a feeling of surprise at the manner in which
  amendments are moved and accepted in this house without any previous notice. I feel that when
  important amendments are submitted, adequate notice must be given, so that all delegations may
  be present here and may express their viewpoint. I was surprised that a move for increasing the
  number of members of the Headquarters Committee should have been made in the course of a
  discussion which was really meant to consider the problems of the Headquarters Committee. I do
  not see any purpose in introducing an amendment of this nature at this stage, which was not at all
  expected by most of the delegations. We have been talking all the time about the budgetary ceiling
  for the building committee, and about various other aspects which should effect economies in the
  building. I would like to ask the Acting Director-General whether it is not a fact that, if the
  membership of the building committee is to be increased, that will certainly increase the expend-
  iture that is to be incurred by the frequent meetings of the committee. Moreover, the suggestion
  has been made that the building committee should be constituted on a geographical basis. I have
  never heard of such a suggestion in regard to other buildings. I entirely share the view of the
  delegate of Denmark that the Headquarters Committee should be a very small committee consist-
  ing of experts. I should like in this connexion to state that, when the building of the World Health
  Organization was contracted, a small committee of five members dealt with all aspects of the
   matter. It was a $4,000,000 estimate. I feel that, instead of rushing through this decision at
   the present stage, the whole question should be placed before us for further consideration. I
   would therefore move, in spite of the fact that certain votes have been taken, that the matter be
   discussed tomorrow morning, due notice being given of the amendments and all the members of
   the delegations having an opportunity to discuss them. It is not a question of suggesting that any
   country should not be there or should be there. It is a question of economy and how best to conduct
   business in an organization where the most recent matters of business are the first to receive
   our attention. On that ground, I feel that the question should be reconsidered, and I would re-
   quest you, Mr. President, to postpone decisions on all these points until tomorrow.
   (122) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Gentlemen, we all understand very well
   the reactions of some delegates. I feel that with regard to the amendments, since they have been
   voted by a large majority, there is no question of going back on them. As to the number of mem-
   bers to be added to the Committee, the Chair is in the hands of the meeting, and it is for you to
   decide whether this Committee shall have fourteen or fifteen members. The delegate of India has,
   however, suggested that the discussion should be postponed until tomorrow. Is the Conference
   agreed on adjournment until tomorrow?
   (123) Mr. VERNIERS (Belgium) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, I apologize for
   having to put forward a rather more radical proposal. I have the impression that because of the
   lack of proper air conditioning, this meeting did not really know what it was about and voted, I
   should say out of sheer fatigue, resolutions that it would have been worth while looking at more
   closely. I agree entirely and absolutely with the opinion expressed by our colleague Mr. Mudaliar.
   The addition of a number of members to the Committee cannot but involve us in further expense
   and we have not the money to meet it. I therefore propose straight out that the vote we took just
    now on the increase of the membership of the Committee from eleven to fourteen be annulled and
    that we take the question up again tomorrow. We shall have had time to think things over.
    (124) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) I do not regard the fact that
   Spain has been elected to the fourteenth place on the Committee as implying that it would be tact-
    less of me to speak on this subject. Various reasons have been invoked for opposing this decision
    and thus annulling a definite agreement. That would be a very dangerous precedent, though I will
    not attempt to say whether it would be revealed as such quickly or slowly. This may sound like
    censure of the Chair, but what is not possible is to cancel a definite agreement. That would not
    be a responsible or a legal action, and it would be unprecedented.
    (125) I should also like to contest the main argument that the addition of a few more members
    would slow down the work. Yet another of the arguments advanced, that relating to the cost is
    not tenable. Three fewer members, if honorary and unpaid, would at most mean saving the cost
    of three pencils. The question of expense can certainly not prevent us from increasing the mem-
    bership of the Committee by three. There are no expenses to be met: we receive no fees or
    remuneration; we are offering a generous, spontaneous and disinterested collaboration. Thus
                                                         - 94 -

the economy argument breaks down. However, I call the President’s attention to the legal pre-
cedent we shall be setting up if we cancel the agreements we have just reached.
(126) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, however good
the reasons may be for disapproving of the vote that has been taken, I do not think we could agree
to go back on a decision which has been officially announced. As a member of the Committee I
should like to say that our duties are not technical and that we are not paid for our work. I have
been sitting on the Committee for two years. I have never had the shadow of remuneration and I
would never dream of expecting it. I therefore think that whatever may be the defects of a reso-
lution, once it has been adopted by the Conference, there is no question of going back on it.
(127) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Does Mr. Verniers maintain his proposal?
(128) Mr. VERNIERS (Belgium) - (Translation from the French) Mr. President, I hope you will
excuse me. To tell the truth, I do not want to discuss the question from the juridical point of view.
Obviously, if we were to undo what we had done as soon as we had done it, we should never get
anywhere. All the same, when you realize, on reflection, that you have made a mistake - and I
think we have made a mistake - you have a perfect right to think about rectifying it, even if it
does involve a little irregularity in procedure. What I am putting to the meeting is a question of
common sense. Mr. Mudaliar expressed it very well. I apologize if my observations look like
an involuntary criticism of the Chair, but in the ordinary way notice of the draft resolution should
have been given in writing; everyone would have been able to think the matter over and we could
then have discussed it. I must say the procedure followed in the introduction of the amendment
was bad.
(129) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) I do not wish to enter into
an argument with the delegate of Belgium, but if we adopt his thesis, we shall have to begin all
over again, because nothing we have approved so far has been submitted in writing. All the
amendments have been proposed verbally and have been regarded as in order.
(130) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Gentlemen, it is on you that the decisions
depend. If my memory serves me, after each of the proposals was made, I asked whether any
delegate wanted to speak, and if I remember right, I only put the proposals to the vote when I
met with silence, your silence. Consequently, I think that, since there have been complaints of
the heat not only outside but in here, only the last proposal can be adjourned till tomorrow, that
is to say the proposal for a fifteenth member, As far as that is concerned, you are free to decide
whether you want fourteen or fifteen members, that is your business; but I think that as far as
the other amendments are concerned, they were all adopted by a very large majority. All the
same, the meeting is always free to take a decision reversing what it has previously done. A r e
there any further speakers? Then the question of the fifteenth member is adjourned till tomorrow
morning.
(131) Now, gentlemen, a final question on which I should like us to be all agreed. Are you ready
now to vote on the draft resolution as a whole? Those in favour of adopting the resolution as a
whole? Against? Abstentions? Gentlemen, the resolution is adopted by 44 votes to none, with
6 abstentions. * I call upon the delegate of Venezuela.
(132) Mr. PARRA-PEREZ (Venezuela) - (T ranslation from the French) I am speaking to you
once more on behalf of the Committee of which I have the honour to be Chairman. You have just
voted to renew your confidence in it by a very considerable majority. The Committee thanks
you, and it takes the vote as an encouragement in its future labours. It will continue to work for
you with the same whole-heartedness and the same enthusiasm because it is your creation and
because it represents the Conference. You can count on our complete loyalty. I think that, in
view of the collaboration which the Committee has enjoyed up till now with the French authorities,
with the administration of Unesco and with the architects, to whom I have pleasure in paying a
tribute, the work of the Committee will become more and more efficient and that at your next
meeting in Montevideo, it will be able to submit to you reports as encouraging and decisive as
hitherto.
* Including the United Kingdom and the Union of South Africa

   RESOLUTION ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION FOR A SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF                   MANKIND
   (133) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) I call upon the Chairman of the Executive
   Board.
   (134) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom) , Chairman of the Executive Board, Mr. President and
   fellow delegates, in accordance with your instructions, the Chairman of the International Com-
   mission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind, the Secretariat and I worked through
   what the Acting Director-General called the noon time until about 3 o’clock in the afternoon, and
   produced a resolution to take care of the deficit in the production of a Scientific and Cultural
   History (2 XC/DR/S).
   (135) This can be done in two ways, either by drawing direct on the Working Capital Fund or by
   not transferring savings to that Fund. We thought it best to adhere to the regulations on the Work-
   ing Capital Fund, and we propose to you a resolution which:
      “Requests the Director-General and the Executive Board to examine the possibility of finding
        such additional funds as may be essential for the continuation of this project in 1954 by a
       transfer within the existing budgetary appropriations,
       Decides that transfers within the budget to replace withdrawals from the Working Capital Fund
        shall not be considered possible unless the essential requirements of the International Com-
        mission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Mankind have been met. ”
   (136) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) If I have correctly under-
   stood the wording of this draft resolution, it proposes that all transfers of available funds shall be
   made for the benefit of the International Commission for a Scientific and Cultural History of Man-
   kind. In other words, that Commission is to have a monopoly and to enjoy preferential treatment
   over the others. In my opinion no one is better fitted than the Executive Board and the Director-
   General to decide what is most urgent and most needed, and I am prepared to trust their decision.
   If they think this project should have precedence over the others, I shall support this draft reso-
   lution.
   (137) Mr. BENDER (Netherlands) - I would like to state very briefly that our delegation is pre-
   pared to support this resolution. Our delegation in the past has had its doubts on this project, but
   we have information now that everything is progressing and it would be a great pity if it should
   have to be abandoned for lack of funds. We therefore move this resolution as presented.
   (138) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Are there any other speakers? I now put
   the draft resolution to the vote. Those in favour of the draft resolution which has just been pro-
   posed? Those against? Abstentions.7 The resolution is adopted by 48 votes to 2, with 6 abstentions.
  REPORT OF THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE
   (139) The PRESIDENT - I call upon Mr. Parra-Perez, Chairman of the Credentials Committee.
   (140) Mr. PARRA-PEREZ (Venezuela), Chairman of the Credentials Committee, (Translation
   from the Spanish) Mr. President and fellow delegates, when I presented the first report on the
   examination of credentials, on behalf of the Committee which had done me the honour of electing
   me Chairman, the Conference approved the suggestion that, in my capacity as Chairman and in
   order to save time, I should be authorized to examine any further credentials which might be sub-
   mitted to the Committee. On the strength of this authorization, I have examined the credentials
   submitted on behalf of the following States: Afghanistan, Australia, Honduras, Luxembourg, the
  Netherlands and New Zealand, and having found them to conform to the provisions of Rule 22 of
   the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, I propose that the representatives of those
   States shall be permitted, or shall consider themselves as having been permitted, to take part in
   the proceedings of the Second Extraordinary Session of the General Conference. I may remind
  you that the delegations of Honduras, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and New Zealand had submitted
  provisional credentials to the Credentials Committee.
   (141) The PRESIDENT - (Translation from the French) Gentlemen, are you in favour of approving
   the report of the Chairman of the Credentials Committee? Approved.
      The meeting rose at 6.30 p. m.

DRAFT RESOLUTION ON WITHDRAWAL FROM MEMBERSHIP OF THE ORGANIZATION (continued)
(1) The PRESIDENT - The draft resolution before us relates to the withdrawal of Member States
from the Organization. I am informed by the United States delegation that they withdraw their
motion (2 XC/DR/8) in favour of the one presented by the delegations of Denmark, Sweden and
Norway (2 XC/DR/ 10). It reads:
  “Hoping that Unesco will continue to adhere to the principle of universality of membership but
   recognizing that withdrawals may at times become inevitable involving certain serious financial
   problems in drawing up the biennial budget of the Organization, this General Conference requests
   the Director-General and the Executive Board to consider the matter of withdrawals from the
   Organization and if appropriate, draft amendments to the Constitution to provide for such with-
   drawals”.
(2) That is the only resolution now before the meeting. I call upon the delegate of Sweden, Mr.
During.
(3) Mr. DURING (Sweden) - I wish to comment very briefly on this resolution and emphasize one
point. The draft resolution expresses the desire to adhere to the principle of universality. The
main problem regarding withdrawal is the financial problem arising from the fact that certain Mem-
ber States do not pay their contributions. This always creates serious difficulties when we have to
prepare the annual or biennial budget. The resolution leaves the matter entirely and in full confi-
dence to the Executive Board, and I wish to stress the concluding words by which we ask the Board
to consider the matter of withdrawals and, if appropriate, to draft amendments to the Constitution.
We do not say when we expect the Board to do this. We leave the matter in full confidence to its
discretion. We have no time to consider this important question at the present brief Conference.
With these comments I recommend the draft resolution for your approval.
(4) Mr. CAIN (France) - (Translation from the French)               The French delegation made certain
reservations at yesterday morning’s meeting regarding both the form and the substance of the draft
resolution which was submitted to you. It is glad that this draft resolution has been withdrawn.
Our delegation declares its acceptance of the Scandinavian draft resolution.
(5) The PRESIDENT - The motion is seconded by France.                 Any observations? I take it you agree
to this resolution. Agreed.

      III-7                                         Plenary      Meetings
      DISCUSSION ON THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE HEADQUARTERS COMMITTEE
      (6) I am told that a suggestion made yesterday is still before the house, namely, that the number
      of the members of the Headquarters Committee be raised from fourteen to fifteen. Consideration
      of this suggestion was postponed until this morning. I call upon Mr. Raadi, Iran.
      (7) Mr. RAADI (Iran) - (Translation from the French)                I have asked to speak in order to submit
      an explanation, or rather a rectification regarding yesterday’s vote. The question of increasing
      the membership of the Headquarters Committee was considered at the end of the discussion on the
      seat of the Organization. The ensuing debate led to some confusion, the result being that when the
      President asked whether the vote should be taken yesterday or deferred until today, some of our
      number, including myself, understood that the vote was to relate only to the choice of day. As this
      matter was not cleared up, some of us wanted time for reflection and abstained from voting. At all
      events, that was the reason for my abstention. When it was announced later that the vote had been
      taken on the resolution, I thought it my duty to explain or rectify my action. The delegation of Iran
      will enthusiastically support the setting up of the Headquarters in Paris and the construction of the
     building in this town. If the vote is regarded as final, we very readily agree to the resolution, and
      I would ask you to permit me to make a rectification in that sense.
      (8) Mr. HAGUIWARA (Japan) - (Translation from the French) There was some confusion at yes-
      terday afternoon’s meeting when we had to vote on an increase in the membership of the Headquar-
      ters Committee, when the President decided to uphold the first resolution raising the number to
      Fourteen, and when the last proposal to increase the number to fifteen was maintained. I do not
      dispute the President’s decision; I should like merely to draw the attention of the Conference to the
     fact that in future, when proposals of this nature are submitted, the Nominations Committee should
     first be approached so as to enable the General Conference to decide later. You will remember
      that at the last session of the Conference, Mr. Bender, Chairman of the Nominations Committee,
      prepared a very full list showing the allocation of Member States between the various Committees.
     Geographical distribution, as we understand it, does not apply to a single committee. But as re-
      gards the various committees that have a longer or shorter life, like the Headquarters Committee
      or the Budget Committee, which continue in being until the opening of the following session, the
     Chairman of the Nominations Committee should see that the same countries are not always repre-
     sented. Practically all Member States should be included in one or other of such committees. In
     my opinion, it is essential to follow this practice and not to act as we did yesterday. If a vote is to
     be taken today on the appointment of a fifteenth member, I hope, Mr. President, that you will ask
     the opinion of the Chairman of the Nominations Committee.
     (9) Mr. NIELSEN (Denmark) - Mr. President, let me say at the outset that, like the previous
      speaker, I of course abide by the President’s ruling at yesterday evening’s meeting that a decision
     taken by this General Conference should stand, although it is true that, at other conferences, cases
     have occurred where a resolution has been formally voted by the conference and afterwards rev-
     ersed by it. That does not, however, apply now.
     (10) Secondly, I want to make a short remark which has a bearing on the whole system of Unesco’s
     methods of appointing commissions. As I said yesterday, our delegation was not in favour of
     raising the number of members of the Headquarters Committee, chiefly because we think that in
     such a delicate matter a small body can do more effective work than a large one. I shall not go
     further into that question, as I spoke about it yesterday. But other questions have to be taken into
     consideration, and that again concerns the whole policy of establishing commissions and committees.
     There is, first of all, the question of cost. It is true that, as Mr. Carneiro reminded us yesterday
     afternoon, his membership of the Headquarters Committee has entailed no expense for the Organi-
     zation since he had received no remuneration for taking part in the meetings of the Committee.
     Admittedly, that is true in his case, but it does not apply in every case. It does not hold good for a
     Member State which has no permanent resident representative at Headquarters. In such a case
     there are two alternatives if the said Member State is elected to serve on a commission or commit-
     tee and a meeting is called. Recourse may be had to a member of the staff of the embassy of that
     country here in Paris. Although this arrangement may be satisfactory in many cases, we cannot
     expect the embassies to have people competent in regard to all questions. The second possibility
     is that a Member State would send an expert to the meeting. The question then arises of the cost
     of his journey. This may be borne by him or by his Government, or it may have to be reimbursed
     by our Organization. Thus the question of economy in our Organization can arise.
     (11) The third point, to which the delegate of Japan also referred, is the principle which was in-
     voked yesterday - that of geographical distribution. I must frankly confess that in a case like that
                                                              - 98 -

                                              Plenary       Meetings                                    III-7
of the Headquarters Committee - a purely technical body - I cannot see that the principle of geo-
graphical distribution has any relevance. Here the only consideration in my view should be to ap-
point the most competent people. On the other hand, the question of geographical distribution can
and does arise in the general system of commissions and committees. There, of course, I adhere,
like the preceding speaker, to the principle that when a series of commissions and committees is
set up, the principle of geographical distribution should be taken into consideration. This might
well be done on the advice of the Nominations Committee.
(12) One last remark. We were unanimous yesterday that our Headquarters Committee had done
magnificent work, and we paid a tribute to that Committee and to its distinguished Chairman, Mr.
Parra-Perez. It seems to our delegation rather illogical not to draw the conclusion that we should
also entrust the task of completing the work to the same group.
(13) I wish to stress these considerations here because I think they have a bearing not only on this
particular question of the Headquarters Committee, but on the whole policy of our Organization in
setting up special committees and commissions for specific tasks.
(14) The PRESIDENT - The Acting Director-General will say a word.
(15) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - Yesterday the Head of the Indian delegation asked me a
question which I did not have the opportunity to answer, since the debate was adjourned until this
morning. The question was whether an increase in the size of the Headquarters Committee would
mean an increase in the cost. I want to make it clear that it does not cost Unesco more money as
far as its own budget is concerned, except perhaps for a few more hours of interpretation - because
it would take a larger committee longer to operate than a smaller one - and except for a few pencils
and sheets of paper. The cost, of course, as was so clearly indicated by Mr. Nielsen, is borne by
the governments, and not by the budget of Unesco.
(16) Mr. VERNIERS (Belgium) - (Translation from the French) I shall begin by saying that I fully
endorse all the observations, ideas and suggestions and all the criticisms expressed by my friends
Mr. Haguiwara and Mr. Nielsen. I would venture to agree with the Acting Director-General, after
first of all thanking him for answering the question I asked yesterday, that an increase in the mem-
bership of the Committee naturally costs Unesco nothing more than the price of a few pencils and
sheets of paper. However, if the condition mentioned a moment ago by Mr. Nielsen is not satisfied
and if the members of the Committee are not permanently settled in Paris, someone must meet the
cost of travel and residence and, whether it is borne on the budget of a Member State or on the
Unesco budget, the expenditure can be regarded as unnecessary.
(17) I shall not dwell on the question of making up committees from members of the embassies in
Paris. I have the highest consideration and the warmest friendship for my diplomatic friends; but
as Mr. Nielsen said, they are not qualified to speak on all subjects and the various embassies in
Paris do not have specialists and technicians available to place at the disposal of Unesco. I should
like to say for the information of this assembly, which includes many members and colleagues who
are here for the first time and who are not fully aware of the position, that this Committee origin-
ally consisted of five, six or seven members - I no longer feel sure of the exact number. The
States were, however, selected at that time because they had permanent representatives here in
Paris. The reason for this was that the Committee had to be able to meet fairly often for very
short periods, and in the future it will have to meet again on various occasions. There seems
then little reason to enlarge it. The membership was afterwards raised from seven to eleven by a
regular vote, and to fourteen yesterday by a snap vote. It is now proposed to increase it to fifteen.
Why not make the number twenty-one? Or thirty-five. Why not put all the Member States on the
Committee? The geographical distribution would then be really observed fully and completely and
no one would have any reason in future to make any criticism. However, as Mr. Nielsen said, we
are dealing with specialists, technicians and people who by their training and qualifications are
entitled to give an opinion.
(18) I do not wish to press the point further and should not like, especially in regard to the Head
of the Canadian delegation who was in the Chair yesterday, to take up again the question of proce-
dure. The vote has been cast. Let us place it on record and make the best of it, as our English
friends say. I should like nevertheless to mention in passing, without wishing to raise the question
or proposing to discuss it fully at present, that according to the Rules of Procedure, there is
nothing to prevent me, by submitting the-text of a resolution with a request for the necessary
twenty-four hours’ delay, from proposing that the Committee should consist not of fourteen or fif-
teen, but of five members for example, specially chosen for their qualifications. There might be
two jurists - a notary and an advocate; two engineers, one of them being a town planning expert,
and the fifth, the Chairman, who would be polyvalent. That would perhaps have been the wiser
                                                       - 99 -

    course to adopt. I believe therefore that we are on the wrong path: I think we have made a mistake,
    and if to err is human, to persist in error is diabolical. Even if the devil appears under the aus-
    pices of Mgr Maroun - I hope he will pardon me - we should nevertheless be suspicious. Now I
    would say that, while I agree to maintain the Headquarters Committee at twice seven, i. e. fourteen
    members, I emphatically object on behalf of the Belgian delegation to the fourteen being increased
    to fifteen. The proposal to do so was made by the Head of the Italian delegation, Mr. Migone. I
     do not know whether he has given us any good reason other than that fifteen is an odd number. That
     reason is not a convincing one, because supposing there are fourteen, they select one of their
    number as Chairman. If all are present - and we should have to ascertain whether all the members
     attended the Headquarters Committee meetings - there might be six against seven. Should one
     member be absent, they might be six on one side and six on the other. At that point, the polyvalent
     Chairman could intervene and incline the scales in one direction or another.
     (19) I have spoken at too great length already, and I offer my apologies. In conclusion, I would
     say that I shall oppose, on behalf of my delegation, an increase in the membership of the Committee
    from fourteen to fifteen, and I should like to remind you, last of all, what the science of palaeontology
     teaches us in regard to living-species. Gigantism when it appears is the sign of decadence and
    approaching extinction. Let us avoid gigantism in our organizations. Let us set up the smallest
    possible number of committees, and when we do create them, let us furnish them with the fewest
    possible members, but members who are competent and who are chosen for their qualifications.
     (20) Mr. MUDALIAR (India) - Mr. President and fellow delegates, late in the evening yesterday,
    when the atmosphere was perhaps surcharged with a feeling of tiredness on the part of all members,
    I ventured to make some few suggestions and to offer some remarks on procedural matters and
    also on the decisions that were arrived at by this Conference in regard to the very important ques-
     tion that was under debate.
     (21) Let me first of all assure those Member States concerned who have been elected to serve on
    this Building Committee that I have nothing to say against such a proposal. The Indian delegation
     is friendly to all Member States, and welcomes any Member State which wishes to participate in
    the activities of the Organization. But I must say frankly, Mr. President, what I think of the pro-
     cedural matter and about discussions that are taking place in this House, because I feel that I shall
     not be true to myself or to the Organization if I do not state that I am somewhat disappointed at the
     manner in which we are conducting our business. In the first place it is unfortunate that we have
     to sit in this very crowded hall, overcrowded by visitors, representatives of other organizations
     and also members of the Secretariat, and we have also to see a constant stream of people passing
     up and down which clouds our vision if it does not actually tend to lower our intellectual level.
     (22) Secondly, I must confess also, that in regard to the translation we very often hear a fading
     voice and cannot possibly follow what is being said. These two difficulties were at their worst
    yesterday when a very important question was being discussed here, a question involving the
     expenditure of over seven-and-a-half million dollars. To add to this, Mr. President - I should be
     corrected if I am wrong in my interpretation - various members came and spoke upon this motion,
     and in the course of their speeches incidentally suggested that they would like some amendments to
     be made. I am not sure that any of those amendments were actually handed over to the Acting
     Director-General in writing; nor were they seconded by anybody to my knowledge. At the end of
     the discussion, if I am not mistaken - I shall apologize if I am mistaken - the representative of the
     Secretariat read out certain amendments and stated these amendments were before the meeting. I
     venture to think that that was not the correct procedure that should have been adopted. Rule 78
     states very clearly: “Draft resolutions and amendments other than those mentioned in the following
     paragraph shall be transmitted in writing to the Secretary-General, who shall circulate copies to
     delegations”. Were the amendments placed in the hands of the Secretary-General? I should like
     to have a positive reply from him in due course, If they were not placed in the hands of the
     Secretary-General, then the question arises whether the procedure is quite correct.
     (23) Moreover, copies of these amendments were to be circulated, except as provided in paragraph
     5, which reads: “Notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing paragraph, the President may
     permit the discussion and consideration of amendments to substantive motions, and to substitute
     motions or procedural motions, without previous circulation of copies”. Now I venture to think
     that, as a copy of the resolution bearing on this subject was already before all the members, the
     correct procedure would have been for a member to have given notice of the amendment and to have
     spoken thereon when discussing the subject. In the very important question that has been considered,
     it is my opinion that these procedural matters were of extreme importance. However, I do not wish
     to take up time to discuss what has been passed because I will accept it, although theoretically some
     objections can still be raised. I think that in future, Mr. President, I would strongly urge that
     these matters should receive much more careful attention at the hands of all of us, the Secretariat
     and others, than has evidently been the case this time.
                                                           - 100 -

                                              Plenary      Meetings                                     III-7
(24) Again, it was said that, after a resolution had been passed, the subject could not be recon-
sidered. In other assemblies I know definitely that there is a rule that by a two-thirds majority a
snap vote on any subject can be reconsidered, and I shall very warmly recommend to the Executive
Board to consider - if there are not rules to that effect in this Constitution - the desirability of
introducing such a provision. It is all the more desirable, because occasionally members who are
not conversant with the various languages may not immediately interpret the meaning of any parti-
cular amendment or may be unable to grasp the full significance of the situation when they are
forced to give their vote. It is exceedingly important for this Organization that we should have an
opportunity of reviewing such a snap vote, if necessary in the light of the full facts that may be
placed before us. I do not by any means wish to suggest that at yesterday’s meeting these facts
were not before the house. But I think it would be good for us to realize that these are directions
in which there should be an improvement in procedural matters.
(25) I would also like to state that it has been the experience in other assemblies that, whenever
such resolutions are adopted - immediately the next morning - all delegates have copies of those
resolutions with them in their respective places. I realize that this is an Extraordinary Session,
that perhaps it was not possible to give effect to all these formalities; but I do hope that the Exe-
cutive Board, the new Director-General and the Secretariat will consider the procedure that is
being adopted in other organizations and try to see that what is good in such procedural matters
is also adopted in our own Organization.
(26) Our Organization has been subjected to some criticism. People outside do not realize the
tremendous difficulties under which we are working, and are not aware that a very large number
of delegations come here and, under the stress of time, having much to deliberate on, have not
much time at their disposal. But I feel that in many respects there is room for some improve-
ment in all these directions. What we aim at, after all, is efficiency at home and honour abroad,
both of which we can secure only if we interpret our duties and responsibilities in as dignified a
manner as we can.
(27) The PRESIDENT - The Acting Director-General will make a statement.
(28) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL - Mr. President, Mr. Mudaliar asked for a direct reply
to one of the points he raised. May I make the following statement? The Lebanese amendment
and the Peruvian amendment were both received in writing by the Secretary here on the tribune.
The Belgian amendment which, as I recall, was one of drafting, was not received in writing. They
were not, however, circulated. May I read parts of Rule 78? No. 1 states: “Draft resolutions
and amendments, other than those mentioned in the following paragraph shall be transmitted in
writing to the Secretary-General, who shall circulate copies to delegations.” Then No. 4 under
the same rule: “AS a general rule, no draft resolution shall be discussed or put to the vote unless
copies of it have been circulated in the working languages to all delegations not later than the day
preceding the meeting. ” But I may call attention to No. 5 of this same rule: “Notwithstanding the
provisions of the foregoing paragraph, the President may permit the discussion and consideration
of amendments to substantive motions, and of substitute motions or procedural motions, without
previous circulation of copies. ”
(29) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) Mr. President and delegates,
the previous speakers have all declared that they feel great respect for what has been agreed upon;
but they have all criticized it and have directly or indirectly asked for its amendment.
(30) Apart altogether from what is laid down in Rule 78, paragraph 5, which the Acting Director-
General has just read to us and which says that notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing
paragraph (No. 4), the President may permit the discussion and consideration of amendments to
substantive motions, and of substitute motions or procedural motions, without previous circulation
of copies, I should like to remind the meeting that the question of enlarging the Headquarters Com-
 mittee formed the subject not of one but of four votes, and the Conference must have been very
absent-minded if it failed to notice that this matter was being discussed. The first point raised
was the increase in the membership from eleven to fourteen, and this was agreed. It was then
 suggested that Greece should be made a member of the Committee, and that, too, was approved.
Then Canada was proposed, and finally Spain, It cannot be denied that the subject was repeatedly
brought before us.
 (31) The increased expenditure which would result from the enlargement of the Committee was
also mentioned with emphasis. It seems to me, after what the Acting Director-General has said,
that in this respect we are showing an excess of zeal on behalf of the finances of the various States,
 since the expenditure will have to be met by the States which send the delegates, and in no case by
 Unesco, whose finances, and not those of the Member States, it is our duty to watch over.

   III-7                                         Plenary       Meetings
    (32) Opposition to the increased membership has also been made on the grounds that the Committee
    has so far worked quite satisfactorily, that the report it has prepared is perfect, and that there is
    therefore no reason to make any change. I should, however, like to point out that, so far, the
    Committee has been occupied with preparatory surveys, plans and documents. We are now pas-
    sing from a project to its implementation, from a survey to actual work; and it is only natural and
    logical that when the work increases the number of members who are to deal with it should like-
    wise increase. I will not dwell on certain allusions to the incompetence of diplomats who claim to
    know everything. We diplomats - I should like to defend the body to which I belong - do not make
    any such claim. We respect the competence of all, and while in the Conference and the Commit-
    tees and, more particularly, on the Headquarters Committee, there are technicians, lawyers,
    engineers and architects, we diplomats, who are here not as diplomats but as the delegates of our
    respective countries, claim the right to participate not as technicians, but as the prospective and
    future owners of a building; and the owner always has the right to supervise everything that is
    being done. When a man who is not a technician decides to build a house, he calls in an architect,
    a foreman and a contractor. Every day he goes to see how the work is progressing, and although
    he does not understand it, he is interested and is defending his own interest, with less knowledge
    than the technicians, perhaps, but with greater zeal and determination.
    (33) I should also like to express my astonishment at the exceptional stress that is being laid on
    this trifling question; today we are holding an exhaustive debate about the advisability of increas-
    ing the membership of the Committee from eleven to fourteen, whereas yesterday, with the great-
    est rapidity and almost without objections being raised, we decided upon the expenditure of
     $7,080,000. ‘Moreover, all the changes in the project without exception were made by following
    the same procedure as that adopted for the increase of the Committee, and all of them were ap-
    proved without the slightest comment. Yet this small point as to whether there are to be fourteen
    members of the Committee instead of eleven seems to cause the greatest excitement, and is pro-
     longing the discussion. It is a matter I cannot understand.
    (34) Mr. JOCHAMOWITZ (Peru) - (Translation from the French) My reason for speaking again is
    the keen interest which our delegation takes in the Headquarters question, first, because the Peru-
    vian delegation has been a member of the Headquarters Committee and secondly, because I think
    light should always be thrown on this problem. After what happened yesterday, I can now say that
    night brings counsel. Obviously, what was done yesterday has surprised you. Decisions were ta-
    ken with a rapidity that astonishes me, and there are several matters which really call for discus-
    sion. For example, during the time that I have been with Unesco, it has been the rule, when nomi-
    nations are considered, to consult the Nominations Committee. Yesterday this rule was ignored.
    If we had deferred the question until today we would, with the counsel which night would have brought
    us, certainly have acted differently. The proposal was made to increase the membership of the
    Headquarters Committee from eleven to fourteen. No one knows why or with what object. The
    number was increased because it was thought necessary for some more delegates to sit alongside
    others. At the Seventh Session of the General Conference the number of seats was raised from nine
    to eleven. Why must this number now be increased to fourteen.7 I do not believe this to be neces-
    sary. It is not a question of expense, for it would cost Unesco and the Member States absolutely
    nothing. If it was desired to increase the number of seats, the permanent delegations to Unesco
    should first of all have been ascertained, and then we should have to know whether these delegations
    included members with the necessary qualifications for this Committee, which is of a very special
    character. Membership of a delegation is not a sufficient qualification for sitting in this Committee,
    where very special and very well defined matters are discussed. I shall go even further; I think
    that the Headquarters Committee has no longer so important a part to play. The Committee was
    exceedingly useful and has even been indispensable up to now, because it had to settle general and
    special problems relating to the building of the Headquarters. Its action really terminated with
    the proposals submitted yesterday, which we approved. I again repeat my congratulations and
    my thanks to all the members and to the Chairman, who have contributed to solving this great and
    extremely important problem. The situation is, however, now quite different. The whole of the
    interest in the Headquarters is centred in the Office which has been created and which I suggested
    yesterday should be called the “Headquarters Building Office” or the “Headquarters Technical
    Office”. This body will assume all the responsibilities. I therefore do not see what part the
    Headquarters Committee will play. The Committee is of a strictly advisory character. But it
    does not seem necessary to consult it on this purely architectural problem.
     (35) I do not call for the Committee to be abolished. I desire simply to state that its action will
    be extremely limited and almost non-existent. Why under these conditions should we appoint a
    fifteenth member? I do not see any advantage in that. The three additional members designated
    yesterday were not required, and the fifteenth member would be still more unnecessary. I am
    therefore against any increase in the membership of the Headquarters Committee.
                                                          - 102 -

(36) Mr. DAOUD AMMOUN (Lebanon) - (T ranslation from the French) The devil is about to reply!
If he has to choose between Mgr Maroun and myself in the Lebanese delegation he will, even if he
hesitates for a long time, finally fix on me.
(37) Our motion was not, as the delegate of Peru said a moment ago, without any object. We
stated that we wished to secure a better geographical distribution. I shall speak to you very
simply on a question of fact. The Headquarters Committee, which incidentally is not composed of
specialists and architects, is merely called upon to co-ordinate in some sort the action of the
General Conference with that of the architects working on the building. Do you believe that the
fact of associating certain States or geographical areas more closely with its work deserved all
this flood of references to principle and the need for economy during the long debates conducted
here? Do you think, for example, that if one of the countries of the Near East had been repres-
ented on the Committee its discussions would have been hampered in any way whatever? We are
one of seven or eight countries with no representatives on this Committee. We submitted this
motion yesterday and we even had the moderation and discretion not to propose ourselves. Would
our appearance on the Committee really have meant, as Mr. Verniers suggested, the entrance of
the devil and led to confusion in its work? Do you not think that it would have been desirable to
allow certain geographical areas to observe more closely the manner in which the work was dev-
eloping and to keep their governments and nations better informed on the subject? That would
cost you nothing, gentlemen, and nevertheless, we have lost nearly an hour today and we lost
three hours yesterday in discussing this question. That was the only object of the Lebanese motion,
and I do not believe that we can in any way be compared either to a saint, for that we certainly
are not, or to the devil, whom we have no wish to be.
(38) The PRESIDENT - I have received notice of a motion for closure. I call upon the delegate
of Iran.
 (39) Mr. RAADI (Iran) - (Translation from the French) I do not desire at this stage to go into the
 substance of the discussion; I think we are aware of all the facts and we now know what the sup-
porters and the opponents of the increase have to say. We can now vote on the figure of fourteen
or fifteen. Whether we wish it or not, whether we regret it or not, a vote has already been cast.
We must now carry through the work which is still before us.
 (40) The PRESIDENT - Those who are for this motion of closure? Are there any members
 against the closure?
 (41) Mr. PHOTIADES (Greece) - (Translation from the French) I think we have now entered on
 very delicate ground and that we are taking part in too many discussions. If a snap vote or a
 diabolical intervention led to the election of my country on the Headquarters Committee, whose
 members, activities, attendance and qualifications are well known to its Chairman, Mr. Parra-
 Perez, I should like to say, Mr. President, that Greece would not wish to take part in the Head-
 quarters Committee.
 (42) The PRESIDENT - Shall I put a motion for closure?
 (43) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) - (Translation from the Spanish) I should like to know what we
 are discussing. My impression was that we were not required to go back over what had been
 agreed, which, as the Chair said last night, had already been approved, and that what was being
 discussed was the increase from fourteen to fifteen. Now we are told that the discussion is to be
 closed. In what terms is it to be closed? Do we abide by what has already been agreed?
 (44) The PRESIDENT - The only resolution before the meeting today is a suggestion to raise the
 number of members on the Committee from fourteen to fifteen. All other points were disposed of
 yesterday and no suggestion has been made to reopen the debate. This is a motion of closure.
 Those against? Nobody is against the motion, so the debate is closed.
  (45) The proposal before the meeting is: “That the number be raised from fourteen to fifteen”.
  Those for? Those against? The motion is rejected. That means the number remains at fourteen.
  INSTALLATION OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL
  (46) The PRESIDENT - We proceed to the next item, the installation of the new Director-General
  in pursuance of the resolution of this General Conference. It is my very great pleasure to extend

     Evans, in his new capacity as Director-General, We are all familiar with his intellectual
     achievements, administrative experience, his progressive outlook, his infectious laughter, his
     vivacious personality and, above all, his devotion to the cause of Unesco. In the days to come,
     international organizations will have to face very severe tests and those in charge of them will
     have to stand up, as sentinels, for human freedom and international conscience. Courage comes
     through an understanding of the struggle for freedom. It is a rule that redeems. From today,
     Dr. Luther Evans is a great international civil servant from whom we expect intellectual integrity
     which does not shrink from truth for fear of offending men; moral courage, which acts aright in
     the light of faith, and devotion to human welfare, which is the paramount duty of an international
     civil servant. On this fourth day of July, which is American Independence Day, we should rem-
     ember that the authentic Voice of America is for an extension of democratic liberties all over the
     world. America was born in revolution and dedicated to democracy. The Founding Fathers had a
     dream in their hearts of extending democratic liberties and freedom all over the world.
     (47) Today also happens to be the Independence Day of the Philippines. We wish the American
     people and the people of the Philippines the best of luck on this solemn occasion when Dr. Luther
     Evans assumes office. I wish to assure him, on behalf of this General Conference and of all the
     delegations, including my own, of our prayerful wishes for a very successful term of office.
     (48) Sir Ronald ADAM (United Kingdom), Chairman of the Executive Board - Mr. President and
     fellow delegates, when I proposed the nomination of Dr. Luther Evans on behalf of the Executive
     Board I made a formal nomination and a short statement on his curriculum vitae. My first task,
     on behalf of all the members of the Board, is to confirm what was said so gracefully by Mr. Piaget
     in his speech at the conclusion of our election, that he has all our confidence and all our trust.
     We know him well. We shall work with him in that great spirit of collaboration which is essential
     between an Executive Board and a Director-General if the work of Unesco is to go on.
     (49) I would like to say that I do not know if we realize that Dr. Luther Evans is giving up one of
     the most important positions in the United States of America, with a lifetime career and a pension,
     to serve this great Organization. He is making sacrifices for it. I have known him for a long
     time and I know his belief in Unesco. The task, as the President has said so much more eloquently
     than I can, is a very great task. No man can carry it out without a strong constitution, a strong
     sense of humour and an abiding faith in the principles of Unesco.
     (50) I think one of his greatest qualities is in human relations. In my experience international
     understanding, cultural relations, or whatever we care to call them, are basically matters of
     human relations between peoples of every creed, race and nationality, and I am quite certain that
     he is pre-eminently fitted in that respect to ensure the closest human relations with all the nations
     that make up this great Organization. I know also because I have visited the Library of Congress
     (in Dr. Luther Evans’ absence) that this great Organization is what we would call in the English
     naval tradition “a happy ship”. I have never been in an organization where there was a staff that
     was as contented as the staff of the Library of Congress.
     (51) I know that the staff here have been thinking of whom they were going to get as Director-
     General; the “couloirs” during the meetings of the Executive Board were rather like the “couloirs”
     during a General Conference. Many people were elected long before the Board had even considered
     them! I know the staff are going to have a Head who will make them happy. I know they are going
     to have a most human personality. I would therefore conclude - in the tale of prophet - that I
     think this is a very fortunate day for Unesco and we shall look back in years to come on the good
     job we did today in choosing Dr. Luther Evans as our Director-General.
     (52) The PRESIDENT - I call upon Dr. Luther Evans.
     (53) The DIRECTOR-GENERAL - Mr. President and delegates. If I may depart a bit from pro-
     tocol, I would like to say also Mr. Chairman of the Board, Mr, Acting Director-General and
     members of the Secretariat. Mr. President, delegates before you, the representatives of sover-
     eign States, believers in different gods, adherents of many religions or philosophies of life, I
     wish to utter a short prayer to my own God. In Unesco one is able to call upon the God in whom
     he believes for assistance without offence to his colleagues. If, ignorantly, I should do offence to
     anyone, I ask your pardon in advance.
     (54) Almighty God, make my heart and spirit humble in face of the mighty tasks which have been
     placed on my shoulders. Make me realize always that the power man exercises springs, not from
     himself, but from the approval of his fellow men. 0 God, make me realize that the work of Unesco
     is the work of many men who believe in many different gods or systems of belief; make me toler-
     ant of all men, and make me respect their right to follow the light shed on their respective prayers

  by their respective creeds or beliefs. Make me forever observant of the truths which wise and
  great men have made plain in many ages, that, almost without exception, the great religions and
  philosophies of life have much in common, and would if practised well, lead man forward toward
  peace and understanding. O God, cleanse my heart of selfishness, pettiness, enmity, revenge,
  anger and unjustified mistrust, and give me strength, wisdom and goodness in greater measure
  than before in order that I may help my fellow men reach Thy goal of peace. Amen.
  (55) Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to you and to the Chairman of the Executive Board for
  the kind remarks which you have made. I shall treasure them as long as I live. They will
  strengthen me in difficult hours.
  (56) For me this is indeed a solemn occasion. I am humble in the face of the tasks which I must
  now assume. But I am inspired by the knowledge of your support and your goodwill. I shall place
  all my energy and imagination at your service.
  (57) It would be inappropriate at this time for me to address myself to the matter of the programme
 and budget, but I must say to you that I have a profound belief, a belief which I am convinced the
  Member States share, that Unesco’s activities are best planned and best understood in long-range
  terms. Let us leave to other agencies and other men primary responsibility for peace in this
  generation; we are working to lay the foundations of permanent peace in terms of many generations.
 When we can truly serve the cause of peace in the short run we are of course glad to do SO, but
  our focus of attention, our main responsibility is to do other work.
  (58) Ladies and gentlemen, I come to serve you as a professional administrator. I must there-
 fore disclose to you what attitudes on the matter of administrative methods I have as I begin my
 work.
 (59) The first attitude of an administrator should be that matters of organization and procedure
 are not fixed by overriding natural laws or man-made constitutions, but rather are responsive to
 the needs of the time and the stage of development of the major phases of work and the habits of
 working together of the members of the staff. The problem of administration is mostly a problem
 in human relations. Good administration requires the widespread participation of the staff at all
 levels in the development of policy; it requires that what is decided be the result of as wide a
 consensus of the staff members concerned as the requirements of time permit; it requires that
 the exercise of authority from above be as rare as possible, except in the form of approval of
 initiatives coming from below.
 (60) Ladies and gentlemen, arrangements of power are established not for the enjoyment of dicta-
 torial authority by men fortunate or unfortunate enough to possess it. No indeed, they are made
 as an essential alternative to the confusion of purpose which would otherwise be present. What we
 need to avoid is the confusion of purpose. I propose to do that in the Secretariat by an increase of
 the organs and procedures of common counsel. I know that I inherit a fine body of men and women;
 and I am sure that we can work together democratically without any loss in efficiency. Indeed, I
 am convinced that the development of a firm body of widely understood policies and methods of
 action will permit the elimination of some burdens of paper shuffling and some blockages of the
 paths of action.
 (61) Ladies and gentlemen, the work of Unesco is largely intellectual, and its staff mostly consists
 of members of learned professions. They are capable of greater achievements and they are
 capable of growth. I propose to assure myself that they understand and accept the policies which
 govern our activities at any given moment, that they respect the necessary minimum of routine
 requirements of the bgreaucracg within which everyone must operate, and then I propose to aid
 them in their work of imagination, their work of thinking through the problems Unesco faces to
 arrive at feasible solutions. I will insist that everyone in authority regard himself as a gardener
 protecting and encouraging the growth of the endowments of nature which the staff members poss-
 ess, in the secure conviction that they will employ those endowments fully to achieve the common
 goal. I shall not be jealous of my authority, insisting on petty observances; no, I shall be profli-
gate in its expenditure to increase the potential of mind and spirit of the members of the Secreta-
 riat. And I shall pardon and defend them when they make honest errors of judgment in the areas
 in which the responsibility for decision is given to them. We are going to be a happy family, draw-
 ing strength from mutual respect, comradeship and the common purpose of serving you of the
 Member States. I shall insist that my colleagues in the work of administering our common affairs
 accept the basic proposition that the authority lodged in administrators is a sacred trust, and that
 it must be exercised in a manner calculated to bring out the best in men.
 (62) Ladies and gentlemen, Unesco is an instrument for the increase of collaboration among the
 Member States. The Secretariat is not, it should not be, an independent power. It should have
 no goals except your goals. I propose to work zealously at the task of discovering the needs and
 wishes of all Member States preparatory to the development of the draft programme and budget
 for 1955-1956. To this end I intend to pay personal visits to most of the Member States before
                                                       - 105 -

 the end of the year, and I shall prepare the draft programme and budget for the consideration of
 the Executive Board in the light of my findings, to the maximum possible degree. Please have
 your governments organize their thoughts, so that my visits may be as fruitful as possible. I
 shall soon communicate with your governments on this subject. It is my fervent hope that mem-
 bers of the Board may be present whenever possible when I talk with governments, and particularly
 that it may be possible for the Chairman or one of the Vice-Chairmen to accompany me on many
 of my visits.
 (63) I think there is no need to emphasize my loyal acceptance of the policy which the Executive
 Board, the General Conference and my three predecessors have so warmly supported of collabo-
 rating closely with the United Nations, the other Specialized Agencies, and regional intergovern-
 mental organizations. Allow me one personal word, however, and that is that I shall derive great
 personal pleasure from continuing the friendly relations which I have had for many years with the
 Secretary-General of the Organization of American States and his fine staff. I shall proceed at
 once to establish warm working relationships with the officers of all the other organizations.
 (64) I feel that I am very fortunate to follow two distinguished Directors-General and a distinguished
 Acting Director-General, and to have all of them as warm personal friends. They have given
 Unesco a wonderful beginning, and I shall approach humbly the task of carrying on the great tradi-
 tions each of them has either established or strengthened. I shall study carefully the problems of
 organization and procedure before making any changes in what they have done.
 (65) I am happy that numerous delegations expressed strong approval of Dr. Taylor’s administra-
 tion of Unesco’s affairs. As a member of the Executive Board I have been well informed of the
 quality of his direction of the Secretariat, and I add my applause to yours. I shall urge him to
 remain as Deputy Director-General until the draft programme and budget for 1955-1956 are sub-
 stantially completed for presentation to the Executive Board. This is all the more necessary
 because of my plan to spend much of the remainder of the year in visits to Member States.
 (66) As the member of the Executive Board with the Longest tenure, I feel that I must report to
 you the deep affection which I have for its members and the great respect I have for the Board as
 one of the principal organs of Unesco. I shall try to continue the cordial and understanding rela-
 tions already existing between it and the Secretariat. To those members of the Board who opposed
 my nomination as Director-General, I offer my hand in friendship in the full knowledge that in
 every case it will be warmly grasped. We will bury no hatchets, because there are no hatchets
 to be buried. The Board members, Like the delegates who voted against my election, acted on
 principle, and I respect them for it. I recognize no one of you as an enemy, and I will accept no
 flimsy evidence that anyone is my enemy.
 (67) I must express to you my happiness that you have taken action on the matter of a Headquart-
 ers building. Unesco has always felt at home in Paris, and now it will feel that it has really be-
 come a permanent part of this wonderful city of light, where the mind and spirit are in such con-
 genial environment and where all cultural forces are strong and dynamic. I regret that my own
 knowledge of France and of the French language is not greater, and I promise you to set about its
 improvement. My wife and son have authorized me to tell you that they will share this task fully
 with me.
 (68) To the delegation of Uruguay and the Uruguayan member of the Executive Board I extend
 warm greetings and assure them of my eager anticipation of the forthcoming session of the General
 Conference in Montevideo. I hope to call on the officers of government there within the next two
 months and discuss arrangements for the Conference. I shall strive to have a good command of
 the language of Don Quixote and Ruben Dario, which I love so much, by the time we meet in
 Montevideo.
  (69) I know many of you take a serious view of certain signs of a growing wave of obscurantism
 in certain countries, including some countries where such a futile and cowardly philosophy of
 frustration and despair is in conflict with the very bases of political and national life. I assure
 you that I have a Lifetime enmity against the enemies of liberty of all sorts and that within the limi-
 tations of my office I shall act vigorously in the light of that enmity. As Thomas Jefferson said,
 in a letter of which as Librarian of Congress I have been the proud custodian for eight years, “I
 have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against all forms of tyranny over the mind of
  man”. This means not only the fierce defence of freedom but also the proud pouring out of one’s
 strength of mind and body for the enlargement of freedom, for breaking the shackles of ignorance
 and prejudice and injustice which hamper the innate upward thrust of the human spirit and make
  life poorer than it might be. In all of our work we must remember that the triumph in a large
  number of Member States of such movements would mean the death of Unesco and the long abate-
  ment of its dream of light, of tolerance, of peace.
  (70) Ladies and gentlemen, Let me end this brief testament of faith in the eventual success of our
 common effort by saying that I do not believe that Unesco is in a state of crisis. Unesco is young,

 but it is maturing rapidly; we must all strive restlessly for it to be fully mature in all its work;
 Unesco is weak, but it is growing stronger; we must strive to speed up its accession of strength;
 Unesco is groping for the best modalities of action to achieve peace and progress through education,
 science and culture, and in this it has made surprising progress in seven years; we must concen-
 trate on the objective of determining consciously what types of activities and what methods and
procedures are fruitful and give them priority over others; Unesco is learning that plastering its
 name on the billboards or parading its achievements on the airwaves is not the way to get its work
done; we must strengthen this approach of modesty and trust all-seeing sovereign governments to
give any benevolent influence we exercise the correct attribution of source; Unesco has not yet
fully developed its most appropriate and most fruitful relationship to the associations and groups
of creative intellectual workers of the world, although much of great value has been done; we must
more fully understand, and cause these workers themselves more fully to understand that their
work of mind and spirit is essential for the forward progress of civilization, and we must secure
their ever increasing collaboration in the common task.
(71) I shall have many opportunities to communicate with you and your governments. The most
important thing for me to say at this time is that I shall be your and their servant, that I shall
strive to know you and their wishes, that I shall try to live up the Constitution of Unesco and the
resolutions of the General Conference, and that I shall love my fellow men. Thank you for the
confidence you have placed in me, and thank you for patiently listening to this brief statement.
(72) The PRESIDENT - I shall now request our Director-General to take the oath of allegiance
to Unesco.
(73) The DIRECTOR-GENERAL - I solemnly swear to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and
conscience the functions entrusted to me as Director-General of Unesco, to discharge these func-
tions and regulate my conduct with the interests of Unesco only in view, and not to seek or accept
instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any government or other authority
external to the Organization, so help me God.
(74) The PRESIDENT - Several members already had the opportunity of expressing our sense of
gratitude to the Acting Director-General. You heard the new Director-General also repeat it. I
have been asked in the name of the whole General Conference to put before you a resolution for
your enthusiastic approval.
  “The General Conference,
   Considering with gratitude the outstanding services rendered to the Organization by Dr. John
   W. Taylor in his capacity as Acting Director-General,
   Appreciating to the full the intelligence. wisdom and efficiency with which he has directed the
   execution of the programme and the administration of the Organization,
   Invites the Executive Board and the Director-General
   To request Dr. John W. Taylor to continue to give the Organization the benefit of his great
   experience and qualities of leadership,
   To take into consideration the feelings of Dr. John W. Taylor in this respect and to make such
   arrangements in this regard as conform to his wishes”.
   Adopted.
(75) With your approval, the contract” will now be signed.
(76) The PRESIDENT - I now declare the Conference closed.
   The meeting rose at 12 noon.

                                                 MEETING
                                    Thursday, 2 July 1953, at 12 noon
                                    Chairman: Mr. BENDER (Netherlands)
ELECTION OF CANDIDATES FOR THE VACANCIES ON THE EXECUTIVE BOARD RESULTING FROM THE RESIGNATIONS
OF MR. EVANS AND MR. RIBNIKAR
 (1) The CHAIRMAN reminded the meeting that, as a result of the resignations of Mr. Evans and
Mr. Ribnikar, there were two vacancies on the Executive Board, and that the General Conference,
at its current Extraordinary Session, would have to elect two people to fill the vacancies for the
remainder of the resigning members’ terms of office. After paying tribute to Mr. Evans and Mr.
Ribnikar for the excellent work they had done as members of the Board, he asked the members of
the Committee to suggest the names of the candidates they would wish to be proposed to the General
Conference.       He asked them to consider the two cases separately and to take first the question of
Mr. Evans’ replacement ; his term of office would have ended in 1956, at the Ninth Session of the
General Conference.
(2) For Mr. Evans’ replacement, Mr. SALOMON (United States of America) proposed that the
Committee should nominate Dr. John A. Perkins, President of the University of Delaware and a
member of the United States delegation to the Second Extraordinary Session of the General Con-
ference of Unesco. He mentioned that Dr. Perkins was a distinguished political scientist and, out-
lining his career, emphasized the important part he had played in both education and public affairs
in the United States of America.
(3) Mr. Salomon’s proposal was seconded by Mr. KRUYT (Netherlands) and Mr. CARNEIRO
(Brazil), and adopted by acclamation. It was thus decided that Dr. Perkins’ name should be pro-
posed to the General Conference to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Evans.
(4) The CHAIRMAN then asked the Committee to consider the question of Mr. Ribnikar’s replace-
ment ; his term of office would have ended in 1954, at the Eighth Session of the General Conference.
(5) Sir Ben Bowen THOMAS (United Kingdom) proposed that the Committee should nominate Dr.
Hermann Zeissl, Director-General at the Federal Ministry of Education in Vienna.              He recalled
that Dr. Zeissl had been the Head of the Austrian delegation at the sessions of the General Confer-
ence held in Mexico City (1947), Beirut (1948), Paris (1949), Florence (1950). and Paris (1951,
1952 and 1953). Sir Ben Bowen Thomas gave a brief sketch of Dr. Zeissl’s career, drawing the
Committee’s attention to the advisability of replacing Mr. Ribnikar by some distinguished person
belonging to a country in the same geographical region.
(6) The proposal made by Sir Ben Bowen Thomas was seconded by Mr. de ICAZA (Mexico) and
Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain).
(7) Mr. CHEN Yuan (China) asked the Committee’s permission to submit another name, that of
Dr. N. V. Massaquoi, Assistant Secretary of Education in Liberia and Chairman of the Liberian
National Commission for Unesco.            He observed that the African continent had not so far been re-
presented on the Executive Board, and that it was important to remedy this state of affairs.

 IV-1                                     Nominations                      Committee
 (8) Recalling the debt of gratitude that Brazil owed to the African continent, Mr. CARNEIRO
 (Brazil) also supported Dr. Massaquoi’s nomination.
 (9) Mr, HAGUIWARA (Japan) agreed with the two previous speakers and also seconded Mr. Chen
 Yuan’s proposal.
 (10) Count de CASA ROJAS (Spain) appreciated how useful it would be to have the African continent
 represented on the Executive Board, but felt that, having regard to the precedents established, the
 new member should be chosen from a country belonging to the same geographical region as that of
 Mr, Ribnikar. He also thought it important that the Board should have a German-speaking mem-
 ber. He therefore continued to favour Dr. Zeissl’s nomination.
 (11) Mr. DUPUY (Canada) agreed that it was highly desirable that the African continent should be
 represented on the Board. He pointed out, however, that members of the Board elected at the
 Eighth Session of the General Conference would hold office for a full normal term.                                                    He therefore
 considered that, in order to give the African continent full recognition, it would be better to post-
 pone until the 1954 session the election of a representative of that continent to fill a vacancy on the
 Board.       He was therefore prepared, as matters at present stood, to support Dr. Zeissl’s nomina-
 tion.
 (12) Mr. MALIK (India) supported Mr. Chen Yuan’s proposal that Dr. Massaquoi’s candidature
 should be put forward to the General Conference.
 (13) The CHAIRMAN then asked the members of the Committee to vote by secret ballot on the two
 names before them.
  (14) Mr. JOCHAMOWITZ (Peru) and Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) were appointed
 tellers.
  (15) After the counting of the votes, the CHAIRMAN announced the results, thus :
 Number of Member States entitled to vote at the current session of the General Conference . . .                                                          62

  (16) It was therefore decided that Dr. Zeissl should be proposed to the General Conference as the
  candidate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Ribnikar.
     The meeting rose at 1 p-m
                                                                   - 112 -

                                                 MEETING
                                    Wednesday, 1 July 1953, at 10.45 a.m.
                                  Chairman :  Mr. P ARRA-PEREZ (Venezuela)
(1) Mr. SABA (Legal Adviser), referring to document 2 XC/BUR/l, reminded the meeting of the
Executive Board’s decision to recommend to the General Conference the re-election, at its Second
Extraordinary Session, of the President, ten Vice-Presidents and Chairmen of Commissions and
Committees who constituted the General Committee of the Seventh Session (or members of the
delegations from which those Officers were chosen). He accordingly enquired whether the Creden-
tials Committee was prepared to re-elect as Chairman the delegate of Venezuela.
(2) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) proposed that, in accordance with the Executive Board’s re-
commendation, Mr. Parra-Perez, delegate of Venezuela, be elected Chairman of the Committee.
(3) That proposal was seconded by Mr. MUDALIAR (India) and Mr. Parra-Perez was elected
Chairman by acclamation.
(4) The CHAIRMAN asked the Secretary to read the list of credentials communicated to the
Director-General in conformity with Rule 22 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference.
Those credentials were submitted by the following States : Austria, Belgium, Canada, China,
Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, German Federal
Republic, Greece, Haiti, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Japan, Laos, Liberia, Libya, Mexico,
Monaco, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Saudi-Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thai-
land, Union of South Africa, United Kingdom, United States of America, Viet-Nam, Yugoslavia.
(5) The Committee agreed to regard those credentials as fully valid.
(6) At the CHAIRMAN’s request, the SECRETARY informed the meeting that credentials in the
form of a letter, a telegram or some other document issued by a Minister other than the Minister
for Foreign Affairs and not authorized by the latter, by the Head of a diplomatic mission, or by a
senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were submitted by the representatives of the
following States : Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Egypt, Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan,
Korea, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Nicaragua, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Syria, Turkey,
Uruguay and Venezuela.
(7) The CHAIRMAN suggested that the Committee should propose to the General Conference that it
accept the documents thus received as provisional credentials for the representatives of the above-
mentioned countries, on the understanding that the delegations concerned would later submit regu-
lar credentials and meanwhile take part in the work of the Second Extraordinary Session of the
General Conference.
(8) The Committee approved that suggestion which it decided to transmit to the General Conference.
(9) At the CHAIRMAN’s request, the SECRETARY stated that to date the following countries had
neither communicated credentials nor sent delegations to the Second Extraordinary Session of the
General Conference : Afghanistan, Argentina, Bolivia, Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala,
Hungary, Nepal, Poland, and Union of Burma.

      V-l                                    Credentials         Committee
      (10) On the proposal of Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom), it was decided that the Chairman of the
      Committee should communicate the list of those countries to the General Conference.
      (11) Mr. SABA (Legal Adviser), pointed out that if the delegations of some of those countries sub-
      mitted credentials within the next few days, the Credentials Committee would hardly have time to
      meet again to verify them. He therefore suggested that the Chairman of the Committee be autho-
      rized to examine them himself and to report immediately to the Plenary Conference, so that the
      delegations in question might be authorized to take part without delay in the work of the Extra-
      ordinary Session.
      (12) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) fully appreciated the desirability of the procedure suggested
      by Mr. Saba, but thought it advisable for the Chairman of the Credentials Committee to consult
      with the President of the General Conference and obtain his approval before recommending that the
      General Conference admit any particular delegation to take part in its work.
      (13) The Committee decided to invite its Chairman to apply the procedure just described by Mr.
      Cowell if further delegations submitted their credentials.
      (14) The SECRETARY then informed the meeting that three non-Member States, Finland, Ireland
      and the Holy See and three international organizations, the United Nations, the International Civil
      Aviation Organization and the International Labour Organization had supplied the names of their
      observers.
          The meeting rose at 11. 30 a. m.

                                   EIGHTH SESSION
                                          FIRST MEETING
                                   Monday, 23 February 1953, at 10 a.m.
                            Chairman: Mr. THOMSON (United States of America)
                                    later: Mr. PARRA -P EREZ (Venezuela)
ADOPTION OF AGENDA (8      HQ/l)
(1) As all members had not yet arrived, the CHAIRMAN proposed that the election of officers be
postponed for the time being. He suggested that, after hearing a brief report from the Acting
Director-General on the contract with the three architects discussed at the previous meeting, Mr.
Breuer should be asked to say a few words on the present state of the plans. The Committee would
then consider items 1, 2. 3, 4 and 5 of its agenda. Two further items should be added to the agenda,
namely: 6. Date of Extraordinary Session of the General Conference ; and 7. Date of the next
meeting of the Headquarters Committee.
(2) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) wondered whether an item should be added on the date for the
circulation of preliminary plans outside the immediate circle of the Headquarters Committee.
(3) The CHAIRMAN replied that the matter could be discussed with Mr. Breuer.
(4) The agenda, as amended by the Chairman, was adopted.
APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
(5) The minutes of the last meeting (7C/HQ/SR. 4) were approved.
(6) At the request of the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL, Mr. MONTAGNIER reported on the
arrangements concluded with the group of three architects. He recalled that the Committee, at its
last meeting, had expressed a wish that expenses be reduced as much as possible ; the Secretariat
had accordingly negotiated with the architects with that aim in view and, thanks to their spirit of
co-operation, it had been possible to reduce their fees by $5,000, i. e. from $30,000 to $25,000.
Further, Messrs. Breuer and Nervi having generously agreed not to have their travelling expenses
reimbursed, nor to accept any per diem allowance during their stay in Paris, an economy of
 $8,000 had been effected.
(7) A substantial economy had also been made on administrative expenses; instead of appointing a
P. 4 official to act as liaison agent between the Secretariat and the architects, the work had been
undertaken by the Bureau of Conference Planning and General Services, thus reducing costs from
 $8,693 to $2.000. Therefore the original total estimate of $101,000 had been reduced to $82, 000.
(8) Mr. Montagnier then read Article IV of the new contract with the architects, pointing out that
it was the only Article differing from those appearing in the earlier contract.
(9) Mr. VALEUR (France) congratulated the Secretariat on its negotiations and economies, and
paid tribute to the disinterestedness of the architects.
ELECTION OF OFFICERS
 (10) The CHAIRMAN recalled that the Committee had approved the procedure of rotation of officers,

     VI-8. 1                               Headquarters Committee
     with particular reference to the Chairman; he therefore earnestly requested the Committee to re-
     lieve him of his responsibilities, adding that his Government concurred in his request.              After
     welcoming the three new members of the Committee and paying a tribute to those who had retired,
     he expressed his gratitude to all members for their warm and unfailing support, to the French re-
     presentative for his cordial co-operation, and to the Acting Director-General and members of the
     Secretariat for the very effective help which they had given the Committee.
     (11) Pointing out that the first phase of the Committee’s task would not be terminated until the
     Extraordinary Session of the General Conference had approved the plans submitted to it, Mr.
     CARNEIRO (Brazil) proposed that, in the interests of continuity, Mr. Thomson be re-elected
     Chairman.
     (12) Although deeply touched by Mr. Carneiro’s proposal, Mr. THOMSON (United States of
     America) very gratefully declined the honour.
     (13) After praising the skill with which Mr. Thomson had conducted many difficult meetings and
     the sterling work which he had done, Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) proposed as Mr. Thomson’s
     successor Mr. Parra-Perez, who had had previous experience of building problems at the League
     of Nations, and who had rendered such valuable service to Unesco’s Executive Board.
     (14) The proposal was unanimously adopted by acclamation.
     (15) The CHAIRMAN having called for nominations for the post of Vice-Chairman, Mr. CARNEIRO
     (Brazil) proposed Mr. Malik.
     (16) Adopted unanimously by acclamation.
     (17) The CHAIRMAN’s proposal that Mr. Davies be re-elected Rapporteur was also adopted
     unanimously by acclamation.
     (18) Taking the Chair, Mr. PARRA-PEREZ expressed his gratitude to his colleagues for the
     honour that they had done him, praised the work of Mr. Thomson and paid a warm tribute to the
     French authorities for the extraordinary courtesy and goodwill which they had always displayed
     throughout the negotiations relating to the Headquarters building.              He added that he was greatly
     honoured to have the support of Mr. Malik and Mr. Davies.
     (19) Mr. VALEUR (France) and Mr. DAVIES (Australia) both expressed warm appreciation of the
     excellent work done in difficult circumstances by Mr. Thomson, and their satisfaction that he
     should be succeeded by so distinguished a Chairman as Mr. Parra-Perez.
     (20) The CHAIRMAN called upon Mr. Breuer to report on the plans for the new building.
     (21) Drawing attention to a number of charts affixed to the wall, Mr. BREUER explained that he
     and his colleagues had made their plans with two considerations in mind: (a) town planning require-
     ments; (b) the functions and aspect of the Unesco building. They had come to the conclusion that
     although they should complete the composition of the Place de Fontenoy it was not absolutely
     necessary to follow the architectural composition too strictly. As there was more space available
     than there had been at the Porte Maillot site, they had felt that they could design a building which
     would be really suitable for Unesco. Taking account, however, of the nearby historical buildings
     and particularly of the Ecole Militaire, they had decided that the Unesco building should not exceed
     seven or eight stories, i. e. approximately twenty-nine metres ; that made concentration necessary,
     and so they planned to have one main entrance hall in the principal building with one central line of
     vertical communications.         To avoid having long corridors, that building had been designed in the
     shape of a “Y”, with all the offices on the periphery so that the light would be good. With regard to
     the Conference building, the architects had studied Unesco’s requirements during the Seventh Ses-
     sion of the General Conference; in consequence, they had planned a delegates’ lounge to serve as a
     central meeting place, and all the Conference rooms were axed on that.                The Conference building
     was connected with the main “Y”-shaped office building. The building designed for meetings of the
     Executive Board was separate, but also connected with both the other buildings.
      (22) In conclusion, Mr. Breuer stated that the layout which he had described had been approved
     both by the International Panel of Five Architects and by the French Authorities.

                                     Headquarters            Committee                                    VI-8.1
(23) Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) suggested that it would be a great economy to have the Executive
Board room in the Conference building. Further, he pointed out that two façades of the Secretariat
building faced north and would have to be heated more than the third side, which might cause diffi-
culties.
(24) Mr. BREUER replied that the reasons for placing the Executive Board room in a separate
building were purely architectural. The architects had considered incorporating it in the Confer-
ence building, but had decided that it would make the latter too large and clumsy; also they had
been informed by the Secretariat that it would be possible to have the Executive Board room
separate from the Conference building. Mr. Breuer did not believe that its incorporation in the
Conference building would entail any economy, as the latter would have to be enlarged.
(25) With regard to Mr. de Clementi’s second question, the heating would be zoned and thermo-
statically controlled, so that there would be no wastage.
(26) In reply to a question from Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom), Mr. MONTAGNIER said that the
Executive Board room would be used for other meetings when the Board was not in session.
(27) Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) thought that, in that case, it would be more logical and more con-
venient for small delegations during the Conference to have all the Conference rooms in one build-
ing.
(28) Mr. MONTAGNIER explained that the architects had originally thought of having all the Con-
ference rooms in one egg-shaped building between the two branches of the “Y” on the Place de
Fontenoy. For architectural reasons, it had been suggested that the egg-shaped building be divided
into two, and it was at that point that the Secretariat had been asked if the Executive Board room
could be separated from the other Conference rooms.
(29) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) did not share the views of Mr. de Clementi. He thought it a very
good thing for the Board to be dissociated from the General Conference and to have a building
where it could work in tranquillity away from the noise and bustle of the Conference.                Further,
when the Board met during the year, it would not be necessary to mobilize the larger Conference
building, which should be kept only for big meetings. He pointed out that the plans before the Com-
mittee were the outcome of long study and discussions and had finally been approved by all con-
cerned; in view of the shortage of time, it would be most inadvisable to start revising them at the
present juncture.
(30) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom), seconded by Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) suggested that a
Conference room might be created in the office building itself; such a room would serve both for
meetings of the Board and for departmental and inter-departmental meetings.
(31) Mr. BREUER pointed out that the architects had always been given to understand that the
Executive Board, unless in a separate building, was to be grouped with the General Conference and
not with the Secretariat. With regard to the possibility of including it in the Secretariat building,
the latter was supported by columns at a certain distance one from the other.                Architecturally it
would be difficult to insert a room measuring over 200 square metres, i. e. 15 m x 15 m, inside
the span of the columns. However, if the reason were important enough, it could of course be done,
if necessary by changing the column span.
(32) On the subject of inter-departmental meetings, Mr. MONTAGNIER explained that provision
had been made in the Secretariat building for six small rooms, measuring approximately 36 square
metres.
(33) Mr. MALIK (India) suggested that the branch of the Secretariat building pointing towards the
Conference building might be extended to meet it, thus providing accommodation for the Executive
Board between the Secretariat and the General Conference.               He proposed that the Committee in-
form the architects that it would prefer the Executive Board room to be included in one of the two
blocks, i. e. either in the Conference building or in the Secretariat building, as at present planned,
or extended, leaving it to them to see if it was architecturally possible.
(34) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) seconded Mr. Malik’s proposal
(35) The CHAIRMAN, supported by Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) did not think that the
                                                     - 117 -

  Committee had enough information at its disposal to issue any instructions to the architects. Fur-
  ther, he would have preferred to avoid a vote at the present stage. He therefore proposed that the
  question of the Executive Board room be referred for study to the architects and the Secretariat,
  requesting them to report back to the Committee at the earliest possible moment.
   (36) Seconding the Chairman’s proposal, Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) asked if the possibility could
  also be studied of suppressing the Executive Board building for the time being, leaving it to the
   General Conference to decide, if it so desired, to have a small building constructed for the Execu-
  tive Board at a later stage.
       Agreed.
   (37) The procedure proposed by the Chairman was approved. It was agreed that Mr. Breuer. in
  consultation with the Acting Director-General, would study the problem in the light of the Commit-
  tee’s debate and submit an alternative proposal to the Committee on Wednesday afternoon 25 Feb-
  ruary, at 3 p.m.
       The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

                                       Wednesday, 25 February 1953, at 3 p.m.
                                      Chairman Mr. PARRA -P EREZ ( Venezuela)
    PROPOSALS RELATING TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF ROOMS FOR THE EXECUTIVE BOARD (document HQ/5, doted 24
     February 1953)
    (1) Presenting document 8 HQ/5, the CHAIRMAN recalled that Mr. Breuer had been requested to
    prepare, in consultation with the Secretariat, a paper containing alternative proposals relating to
    accommodation for the Executive Board. Certain members of the Committee had objected to the
    construction of a separate building for the Executive Board, as planned by the architects, and had
    asked if it would be possible to incorporate the Executive Board rooms, either in the Secretariat
    building or in the General Conference area. Mr. Carneiro had reminded the Committee that the
    General Conference had envisaged the construction of the Headquarters building in different stages,
    and he had therefore proposed that the architects and the Secretariat consider the possibility of
    eliminating the Executive Board building for the time being, leaving it to the General Conference to
    decide, if it so desired, to have a small building for the Executive Board built at a later stage. The
    financial and architectural implications of the three proposals were given in document 8 HQ/5.
    (2) Referring to the columns mentioned in paragraph (1) (d) on page 1 of document 8 HQ/5, Mr. de
    CLEMENTI (Italy) asked whether they were to go right through to the top of the building, or whether
    they stopped at the first floor, in which case it might be possible to incorporate the large room for
    the Executive Board in the Secretariat building on the second or third floors, for example. Second-
    ly, Mr. de Clementi objected to the statement in the last paragraph on page 3 that the French
    Authorities had approved the plan. He recalled that the French Authorities had approved the gen-
    eral proportions, but not the details of the plan.
    (3) Replying to both questions, the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL said that the columns went

   Authorities was not strictly accurate and should be amended.

                                           Headquarters          Committee                               VI-8.2
  (4) Mr. VALEUR (France) confirmed that the French Authorities had only approved the general
  proportions. What seemed to him more important was that, thanks to the heroic efforts to effect
  economies made by the Secretariat and the architects, a plan had been devised which could be
  carried out within the $6.000.000 ceiling fixed by the General Conference. If additional reductions
 had had to be envisaged, in order to keep within that ceiling, he would have been in favour of the
 third proposal, i. e. the suppression of the Executive Board buildiang, but, as that was not the case,
 he saw no reason why the Committee should not approve the separate building, even if it proved
 slightly more expensive. He thought that it was generally recognized that it would be desirable for
 the Board to have its own room, a lounge for members and an office for its secretariat, in a
 separate building.
 (5) Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) asked whether the $6,000, 000 included a sum for artistic works,
 i. e. paintings, tapestries, sculpture, etc., to be installed in the new building, in order to give it
 tone and make it a worthy monument to twentieth century thought.
 (6) Mr. MONTAGNIER explained that a sum of $151,000 had originally been allowed for co-opera-
 tion with artists; however, in seeking for places where economies could be made, it had been de-
 cided to reduce that sum to $110.000, which represented 2% of the total expenditure, the proportion
 usually reserved for that purpose in some national legislations when budgeting for new buildings is
 1% or 2% of the total estimates.
 (7) Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) pointed out that the total reduction of building costs amounted only
to 10% whereas a 50% cut had been made on works of art. He considered the proportion unfair and
thought that the Committee should decide to suppress the separate building for the Executive Board,
 adding the $67,000 thus economized to the sum for co-operation with artists.
 (8) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) noted that the only one of the three solutions in document 8 HQ/5
which would lead to any economy was the third, and that that would mean reducing the Executive
 Board to the status of a poor relation of the General Conference and the Secretariat, wandering
through Unesco House in search of accommodation. In his opinion, therefore, that solution should
be rejected at once. Nor should the Executive Board be sacrificed to the artists; he reminded Mr.
 de Clementi of certain precedents which might well be followed; in the cases of the “Palais des
 Nations” and the IL0 building in Geneva, each Member State had been asked to contribute some
work of art. He did not wish to suggest that Member States should be left entirely free in their
choice of such works of art, but that they should be asked to select works in accordance with a
plan established by the General Conference, the Headquarters Committee and the architects; the
plan would include names of artists and works.
(9) Mr. CHEN Yuan (China) was in favour of the original design, providing a separate building for
the Executive Board, because it would cost more instead of less to incorporate the Executive Board
rooms in either of the other two buildings. Further, he considered it desirable for the Executive
Board to have its lounge and secretarial facilities attached to its meeting room, instead of in
another building. Thirdly, he supported the plan for a separate building because, having no know-
ledge of architecture himself, he trusted the architects who had stated that such a solution would be
the most satisfactory from the architectural point of view.
(10) Mr. MALIK (India) fully agreed with Mr. Carneiro that the third solution should be ruled out,
as the Executive Board should not be left in such a situation. He was prepared to accept the views
on the other two solutions expressed by Mr. Breuer and the Secretariat, provided that he was given
an assurance that they had borne in mind the atmosphere that had prevailed at the last session of
the General Conference, when it had been said that expenditure for the Headquarters building
seemed to be excessive when compared with programme expenditure, and that they had explored
every possibility of cutting down space. For example, the Executive Board room, measuring
2 4 0 m , seemed to have been planned on a somewhat luxurious scale. However if he received that
assurance, he was prepared to agree to a separate building for the Executive Board.
(11) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL, replying to Mr. Malik, stated that space had already
been reduced to the extent of some 13,000 m2; such a sacrifice had been considered reasonable, but
                                                       - 119-

   VI-8.2                                 Headquarters           Committee
  it did not allow for expansion. The size of the room where the Executive Board usually met in
                                                            2
  Unesco House measured 320 m2, so that 240 m represented a room smaller by one-third. Although
  the Executive Board did not meet more than four times a year, the room would be used in between
  its sessions for various other meetings, which would otherwise have to be held in the General Con-
  ference area ; as had already been pointed out, the utilization of the larger building for such meet-
  ings would prove more costly.
  (12) While appreciating the force of the Acting Director-General’s remark, Mr. COWELL (United
  Kingdom) said that it made him feel that the General Conference building was to be an even larger
  white elephant than he had at first feared, for it now appeared that it would be used only once every
  two years, if the Executive Board had a separate building. Like Mr. Malik, he considered that the
  Board’s room had been planned on a lavish scale, for he remembered when the Board had held
  meetings in the converted half of the entrance hall of the Hotel Majestic and had had quite enough
  room, However, he assumed that the views of Mr. Breuer and the Secretariat should be accepted,
  and that the Board should have a separate building, provided that : (a) the experts considered that,
  even with a maximum reduction of the Board room, it could not be incorporated in a wing of the
  Secretariat building; and (b) that they were satisfied that maintenance costs would not be higher if
  the Board were in a separate building.
  (13) Mr. BREUER stated that, in the opinion of the architects, maintenance costs would not be
  higher if the Board had a separate building. The janitor service, for example, would cost the
  same, as there would only be one key to the separate building, just as there would be a key to the
  Executive Board room if it were incorporated in one of the other buildings. With regard to space, the
  architects had made great and honest efforts to keep costs down; they had worked on the basis of a
  room measuring 240 m2, because they had been informed that that was what was required; it was not
  in their interests to design too big a room, and they did not consider a large room superior to a small
  one. In order to keep within the six million dollar ceiling, a reduction of 25 to 30% had already been
  made.
   (14) In reply to a question from Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) regarding the space between the columns
   of the Secretariat building, Mr. BREUER explained that the columns were thicker at the base,
   where their diameter was 1 m 40, while at the top, it was 40 cms. The space between the columns,
   from centre to centre, therefore ranged from 5 m 50 at the base to 7 m 50 at the top of the building.
    (15) Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) suggested that, if the Board room was reduced to 200 m2, it might
   be possible, either to insert it at the top of the Secretariat building, or on the bottom floor, if the
   columns could be reversed, having them thicker at the top and tapering down to the base.
    (16) Mr. BREUER remarked that such an operation would be exceedingly expensive.
    (17) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) pointed out that there were three kinds of econo-
    mies to be considered: (1) on actual building costs ; (2) in time ; (3) by ensuring the most effective
    functioning of the building once it had been constructed. He wondered if one of the two large Com-
    mittee Rooms, measuring 200 m2 , in the General Conference area could not be used for the Exe-
    cutive Board, giving it priority for its meetings during sessions of the Conference. However, if
    the suppression of the separate building for the Executive Board would entail a further meeting of
    the Panel of Five, the cost of the latter might offset the economy effected by the suppression of
    the building, in which case it would not be worth while.
    (18) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL stated that a meeting of the Panel of Five cost $1,500 to
     $1,600 for transport alone. Also timing was a problem; a further meeting of the Panel would up-
    set the deadlines fixed for plans to be submitted to the Extraordinary Session of the Conference.
    With regard to Mr. Thomson’s suggestion, it would be possible to give up one of the Committee
    Rooms to the Executive Board, but the latter’s lounge and Secretariat would have to be on a lower
    floor in the Conference building.
    (19) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) supported the proposal to give the Executive Board one of the Com-
    mittee Rooms. He suggested that space might be found for the lounge and Secretariat among the
    storage rooms two floors below.

                                      Headquarters           Committee                               VI-8.2
(20) Mr. PATERNOTTE de la VAILLEE (Belgium) supported Mr. Davies’ remarks.
(21) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) wished it to be quite clear that the Committee did not want
the lounge and Secretariat of the Executive Board to be below ground. He observed that the Com-
mittee Room concerned should be designated as the “Executive Board Room”, so that there could
be no question of the Board’s being a refugee in search of accommodation.
(22) As a member of the Committee, the CHAIRMAN shared the views expressed by Messrs.
Valeur, Chen Yuan and Carneiro, namely that there should be a separate building for the Executive
Board.
(23) Mr. MALIK (India) thought that the suggestion put forward by Mr. Thomson and seconded by
Messrs. Paternotte de la Vaillée and Davies was an excellent one and should be thoroughly explored.
He did not believe that the suppression of the Executive Board building would entail a meeting of
the Panel of Five, as it would not disturb the balance of the two main buildings.
(24) Mr. BREUER suggested a reversal of the programme proposed, as he would feel obliged to
consult all his colleagues before agreeing to the suppression of the Executive Board building. He
therefore proposed that the elimination of the separate building be postponed; it would be just as
possible to eliminate it later on as at the present time. In the meantime, he hoped that the plan
which had been approved by all the architects and the French Authorities would be presented to the
General Conference.
(25) Strongly supporting Mr. Breuer, Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) urged that his proposal be adopted,
mentioning in the Committee’s report to the General Conference that the Committee had considered
the suppression of the Executive Board building, which would entail an economy of $67,000, but had
wished to leave it to the Conference to decide whether or not to suppress it.
(26) Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) was prepared to second Mr. Carneiro’s motion, provided that it
was made clear in the report that some members of the Committee had been in favour of installing
the Executive Board in one of the Committee Rooms in the General Conference area.
 (27) The CHAIRMAN remarked that such points would naturally be mentioned in the Committee’s
report.     The matter would be particularly important if the General Conference decided not to have
a separate building for the Executive Board for the time being.
 (28) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) added that the Secretariat should be asked to revise its estimate of
 space requirements for the Executive Board, stating that it might be included in the Secretariat
building or the General Conference area.
 (29) Note having been taken of the various comments, Mr. Carneiro’s proposal was adopted.
 (30) In view of the difficult negotiations which had culminated in general agreement between the
 architects, the French Authorities and the Secretariat, Mr. VALEUR (France) was very glad that
 the solution proposed by Mr. Breuer and Mr. Carneiro had been adopted, and that there was no
 intention of modifying the plan before its submission to the General Conference.
  ITEM 1 - REVISED STATEMENT OF REQUIREMENTS (8 HQ/ 1)
  (31) The CHAIRMAN wondered whether it was worth while discussing document 8 HQ/l, as the
  statement would have to be revised once again to allow for the suggestions regarding the Executive
  Board room.
  (32) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) thought that the Committee owed the Secretariat and
  the architects a debt of gratitude for the courageous work they had done in cutting down requirements.
  The Committee should perhaps now consider whether the reductions made were not too severe, in
                                                        - 121 -

 VI-8.2                                 Headquarters           Committee
 view of the importance of ensuring the effective functioning of the building for the following thirty
 or forty years.
 (33) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL thought it a pity that it had not been possible to provide
 for expansion. He observed that the requirements had been carefully discussed by Mr. Montagnier
 with all Heads of Departments and Bureaux, who had stated that they were satisfied.
 (34) Referring to page 2, Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) expressed regret at seeing provision for a
 Natural Sciences work room in the basement.
 (35) Mr. MONTAGNIER explained that the wording was misleading; it was not a room for study or
 research, where people would work regularly, but a room where scientific exhibitions and all the
 consignments of the Clearing House would be packed up.
 (36) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) was satisfied with the explanation. He was, however, very sorry to
 see the substantial reduction of space for permanent delegations of Member States. He wished it
 to be stated in the Committee’s report that one of its members, at least, considered that the new
 building was entirely inadequate for Unesco’s needs, and that reductions had been made for reasons
 of economy which would prove very harmful to Unesco in future years. In particular, it was regret-
 table that it had not been possible to reserve more space for permanent delegations, which were
 invaluable living links between Unesco and its Member States. He wished it to be clearly pointed
 out that the Headquarters Committee, in approving those reductions, had been well aware of their
 gravity, but had felt obliged to agree to them for reasons of economy.
 (37) As a member of the Committee, the CHAIRMAN seconded Mr. Carneiro’s remarks.
 (38) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) was sure that many delegations at the General Conference
 would echo Mr. Carneiro’s opinion. He therefore hoped that the Committee’s report would include
 an assurance that the plan allowed for expansion; it would, for example, be possible to extend the
 wings of the Secretariat building.
 (39) Mr. de CLEMENTI (Italy) seconded Mr. Carneiro’s remarks concerning space for permanent
 delegations. It had originally been proposed to allow 75 offices for delegations, and the reduction
 to 25 offices seemed indeed excessive. He therefore proposed that some of the space reserved for
 Special Service and Staff Facility Areas in Part III of the Revised Requirements might be further
 reduced. For example, the Staff Recreation Room and part of the space reserved for the Co-opera-
 tive might be sacrificed, thus making room for two more delegations.
 (40) Mr. MONTAGNIER remarked that the Recreation Room could of course be suppressed, if the
 Committee so desired, but it was customary to provide staff with a facility of that kind. As for the
 Co-operative, it had already been reduced to a minimum, so that the Committee should decide
 either to maintain the space required or suppress it altogether. The Restaurant had also been
 reduced to a minimum and the Clinic had been reduced by one-third.
 (41) Referring to the question of expansion, Mr. BREUER explained that the possibility had already
 been envisaged of constructing an additional building at some future date on the free area to the
 South West. It would cost less to construct such a building than it would to extend the wings of the
 Secretariat building. In the meantime, it should be remembered that the structure of the Secreta-
 riat building was flexible; partitions could be placed wherever required. It was his experience
 that adjustments were always made during the construction of any building.
  (42) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) was opposed to any further reduction of the Staff Facility Areas. He
 recalled the words of Mr. Piaget that “officials employed in international organizations must have
 room to walk and think”. The staff must have a minimum amount of space for social contacts and
 freedom of movement.
  (43) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) could not believe that it was necessary to have eleven rooms for the
  Clinic. He asked how much space was at present available to the Clinic.

(44) Mr. MONTAGNIER replied that the Clinic in the Hôtel Majestic occupied, approximately
120 m2, but the Doctor and nurses were obliged to work in very bad conditions. The waiting room,
for example, was ridiculously small, and people often had to wait outside in the corridor. The
Clinic did not restrict its activities to first aid, but gave treatments, vaccinations, etc., not only
to staff members, but also to their families.
(45) Having participated in the work done by the architects and the Secretariat, Mr. VALEUR
(France) thought that they had made a maximum effort to reduce requirements, and that no further
sacrifice should be demanded of them. The problem of space for delegations could be solved in
time by constructing the additional building of which Mr. Breuer had spoken.
(46) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) remarked that at present only twelve delegations
had offices in Unesco House. In the new building, there would be room for twenty-five delegations.
He saw no point in providing more space, until it was certain that more than twenty-five Member
States would want office space in Unesco House.
 (47) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) pointed out that the reason why there had not been more requests for
 offices was that Member States realized that no space was available and had therefore considered it
useless to put in a request. Many would doubtless avail themselves of the opportunity if space were
available, and Unesco should make it its policy to encourage Member States to appoint permanent
 delegations, as the latter were of immense importance to its work.
 (48) Mr. PATERNOTTE de la VAILLEE (Belgium) proposed that the Secretariat sound Member
 States on the subject before the Extraordinary Session of the General Conference.
 (49) Mr. MALIK (India) moved that the Committee accept the Revised Statement of Requirements,
 on the understanding that the remarks made by members of the Committee would be taken into
 account, and that the Secretariat would do its best to find additional space for permanent delegations
 if possible.
 (50) The proposal was adopted.
  ITEM 2 - CONSIDERATION OF THE REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL PANEL OF FIVE ARCHITECTS (8 HQ/2 and
  Annex)
  (51) At the request of Mr. THOMSON (United States of America), Mr. VALEUR (France) gave an
  account of the atmosphere and character of the meeting that had taken place on 13 February 1953.
  (52) The Committee took note of documents 8 HQ/2 and Annex.
   ITEM 3 - CONSIDERATION OF A LETTER FROM DR. GROPIUS TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HEADQUARTERS COMMIT-
   TEE CONCERNING THE ATTRIBUTIONS OF THE PANEL OF FIVE ARCHITECTS (8 HQ/3)
   (53) The Committee took note of document 8 HQ/3.
   ITEM 4 - CONSIDERATION OF A LETTER FROM DR. GROPIUS REGARDING HIS FEE CONTRACT (8 HQ/4)
    (54) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL, recalling that Dr. Gropius had given more time than any
    other member of the Panel to the matter of Unesco’s new building and had shown great tact in deal-
    ing with very difficult situations, felt it his duty to propose that the Committee officially recognize
    Dr. Gropius as Chairman of the Panel and add a sum of $500 to his fee of $1,000.
    (55) The proposal was strongly supported by Mr. VALEUR (France), and adopted.

 that the fee paid to each member of the Panel was $1, 000 and covered all consultations relating to
 a given project.
  ITEMS _ ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE, ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE
  CARRYING OUT OF THE PROJECT
 (57) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL observed that the item had been covered on the previous
 Monday, when the Committee had discussed the architects’ contracts.
     Agreed.
 ITEM 6 - DATE OF EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF THE GENERAL CONFERENCE
 (58) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) recalled that the General Conference would have to
 consider, not only the report of the Headquarters Committee, but also that of the Chairman of the
 Panel of Five Architects. The opening date of the Extraordinary Session had been provisionally
 fixed as 18 May, but on that date Dr. Gropius would be in Chicago for an exhibition of his works,
 arranged in celebration of his birthday. Mr. Thomson therefore proposed that the Committee re-
 quest the Executive Board to consider the possibility of changing the date of the Conference to 20
 May, when Dr. Gropius would have returned from the United States of America.
 (59) Mr. Thomson’s proposal was adopted.
 (60) .Mr. VALEUR (France) had pleasure in announcing that the French Parliament, at the end of
 December, had voted the sum necessary for the Headquarters loan, i. e. a sum of 2, 100 million
 French francs, which was equivalent to 6 million dollars.
  (61) The announcement was received with acclamation and the CHAIRMAN requested Mr. Valeur
 to convey the Committee’s gratitude to his Government.
  (62) Mr. VALEUR (France) further announced that, thanks to the courteous and cordial co-operation
  of the French Military Authorities, arrangements had been made to evacuate the site at the Place
  de Fontenoy. The Military Authorities had requested a sum of 100 million francs for the construc-
  tion of barracks elsewhere, and as soon as that was obtained, the evacuation, which would take five
 months, would be started. There was plenty of time to complete the evacuation before 1 October,
 which was the date when the architects had asked for the site to be available. In the meantime, the
 Military Authorities had invited the architects to visit the site whenever they wished, provided that
 they did not interrupt the military services.
  ITEM 7 - DATE OF THE COMMITTEE’S NEXT MEETING
   (63) It was agreed that the next meeting should be held on Thursday, 2 April 1953.
     The meeting rose at 7 p.m.

                                          Chairman: Mr. M ALIK (India)

 ADOPTION OF AGENDA (9 HQ)
(2) In reply to a question from Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom), Mr. MONTAGNIER explained
that Item 3 had been inserted in implementation of resolution 29. 3, adopted by the General Con-
ference at its Seventh Session.
(3) The agenda was adopted.
APPROVAL     OF SUMMARY RECORDS     a HQ/SR.   I AND a HQ/SR.  2
(4) Referring to Mr. Breuer’s statement on page 3 of document 8 HQ/SR. 1, Mr. BOUCHARD
(France) proposed that the words “there was no need to follow Gabriel’s composition too strictly”
be amended to read: “it was not absolutely necessary to follow the architectural composition too
strictly”.
(5) The amendment, seconded by Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) was adopted.
(6) Referring to the next sentence in the same statement by Mr. Breuer, Mr. BOUCHARD (France)
proposed the insertion of a full stop after the words “really suitable for Unesco” and the deletion
of the rest of the sentence “and which would serve as a starting point for adjacent new buildings
constructed by the City of Paris”.
(7) The amendment was adopted.
(8) With the above amendments the minutes were approved.
ITEM 1 - CONSIDERATION OF THE PRELIMINARY PLAN AND ESTIMATES OF THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE
PERMANENT HEADQUARTERS BUILDING (presented by the three architects), AND
ITEM 5 - EXPLANATORY NOTES FROM THE THREE ARCHITECTS (9 HQ/4)
(9) Speaking on behalf of the three architects, Mr. ZEHRFUSS announced that Mr. Paquet, Ins-
pector-General of Historical Monuments in France, had approved the plans from the town planning
point of view. The architects had done their best to respect the historical composition of the Ecole
Militaire by closing the semi-circle on the Place de Fontenoy and by planning a building, measuring
28 metres 50 in height, which would not be higher than the other buildings in the group. Secondly,
the “Y’‘-shaped building, in leaving a large open space towards the Avenue de Suffren, was intended
to be symbolic of an organization working for the future; it would stand as a link between the in-
tellectual quarter of Paris and the future extension of the City towards the West. Lastly, and al-
though it had only struck the architects afterwards, the three-winged star of the main building
would represent Unesco’s threefold activities, in the fields of education, science and culture. The
General Conference building had been given the place of honour on the open space towards the West.
(10) Mr. Zehrfuss then gave a detailed explanation of the seventeen plans affixed to the wall and
commented on the model of the new building standing in the middle of the room. He drew attention
to the fact that, as a result of the Committee’s discussions at its last session, the Executive Board
building had been brought closer to the Secretariat building, so that the hall from the Conference

  area to the main lobby led also to the Executive Board room and its offices. The Unesco library
  was to be on the ground floor of the Secretariat building, with direct access from the main lobby
  and from outside. The restaurant, bar, cafeteria and Staff Association rooms were on the seventh
  floor with a view over Paris. There were terraces at the end of each wing of the building. A l l
  offices and workshops in the Secretariat building would have natural lighting. The large Conference
  hall and adjacent commission rooms would be air-conditioned and artificially lighted. The curved
  roof of the Conference area was to be of copper, as it was both very decorative and characteristic
  of Paris.
  (11) Thanking Mr. Zehrfuss for his very clear explanations, the CHAIRMAN said that he was
  personally much impressed by the whole conception. He recalled Ruskin’s saying that Art must
  be not only decorative, but also functional. The architects appeared to have achieved that twofold
  aim and he wished to congratulate them warmly. He requested the Acting Director-General to
  explain the figures on pages 8 and 9 of document 9 HQ/4.
  (12) Referring to page 9, the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL asked members of the Committee to
  add the following figures after the grand total of 1,992, 900, 000 French francs:
       $5,694,000 (corresponding to 1,992,900,000 francs)
       $ 100,000 (cost of Mr. Beaudouin’s original project for the Fontenoy site)
       $     80,000 (cost of the present project)
       $5,874,000
   (13) He recalled that the cost of the intermediary project had been borne by the French Govern-
  ment. The difference between $5,874,000 and the estimated cost of $6, 000,000 was $126,000
  which could be used for the establishment of a technical group within the Secretariat, to act as
   liaison agents between the Director-General and the architects, contractors and sub-contractors.
   (14) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) hoped that document 9 HQ/4 would be revised before it was
   issued as an official Unesco document.
   (15) While explaining that the document had been prepared under great pressure of time by the
   architects themselves, the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL assured Mr. Cowell that it would be
   revised by the editors before being issued officially.
   (16) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) noted that the Unesco building was to be slightly lower than one of
   the official buildings on the Place de Fontenoy, which was capped by a rather unattractive extra
   top storey. He asked the French representative if he did not think that the excrescence concerned
   might spoil the general harmony of the Place de Fontenoy.
   (17) Secondly, he asked the architects if they had considered the possibility of having moving
   staircases in the Secretariat building, in order to avoid the inconvenience and waste of time caused
   by long queues waiting for lifts. Lastly, he asked them if they had taken every precaution to ensure
   that acoustics in the Conference building would be good, both for meetings and for concerts.
   (18) Mr. BOUCHARD (France), replying to the first question, said that the part of the Ministry of
   Labour building slightly exceeding the regulation height was a provisional storey built of brick
   which could easily be removed by the time that the Unesco building was completed.
    (19) Mr. BREUER stated that it was planned to have six lifts, four for passengers, one for freight
    and one half-freight, half-passenger lift. With that number of lifts, the building, containing 1, OOq
    officials, could be evacuated in 20 minutes. The general rule was that it should be possible to
    evacuate a building in half-an hour. Moving staircases, which could carry a very large number of
   people but moved very slowly, were more suitable for stations or large department stores than for
    office buildings. They were never used for more than two or three floors. He pointed out that the
    people on the first two floors of the Secretariat building could use the stairs.
    (20) With regard to acoustics, the architects were convinced that the construction of the Confer-
    ence building would be favourable to acoustics. More exact computations relating to sound absorp-
    tion, distances, etc. would, however, have to be made. Knowledge of acoustics was still incom-
    plete, but a good acoustical engineer should be able to estimate the acoustical qualities of a building
    with 95% accuracy. Everything would be done to ensure the best possible acoustics in the Confer-
    ence building.
    (21) If the architects so wished, Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) would be glad to arrange for
                                                           - 126 -

them to examine the acoustics of the Royal Festival Hall in London, and to visit a new Government
building with a moving staircase up to the first floor.
(22) With regard to document 9 HQ/4, Mr. Cowell thought that it would be strengthened if it re-
corded the fact that the architects, in drawing up their plans, had made a very close study of the
Secretariat and the General Conference as working organisms.
(23) If the architects so agreed, the CHAIRMAN suggested that the fact should be recorded in the
Committee’s final report.
   Agreed.
 ITEM 2 -REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL PANEL OF FIVE ARCHITECTS (9 HQ/l)
(24) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL expressed the Secretariat’s satisfaction at Mr. Le
Corbusier’s report. With the exception of Mr. Markelius, whose reply was still awaited, all the
architects of the Panel had now approved the plan.
(25) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) recalling that considerable difficulties had been encountered at the
outset, thought that the agreement reached was a most encouraging example of international team-
work in such a difficult field as that of modern architecture.
(26) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) thought it should be stressed in the Committee’s
report that the agreement reached was not only an example of international teamwork, but also of
international understanding and co-operation.
(27) It was agreed in incorporate the Panel’s report in the Committee’s report to the Conference,
together with the comments made by Mr. Carneiro and Mr. Thomson.
(28) Returning to the question of internal communications, Mr. RAHIMTOOLA (Pakistan) thought
it pointless to give further consideration to the question of a moving staircase, since it would be
expensive to install and, if it was only to go up to the second floor, it would be unnecessary. He
enquired as to the carrying capacity of the passenger lifts. Mr. Breuer replied that they would
hold twenty-two persons.
(29) Mr. PATERNOTTE de la VAILLEE (Belgium) requested that steps should be taken to enable
foreign firms to submit tenders for the material and equipment to be incorporated in the new
Unesco building. Referring to page 9 of document 9 HQ/4, he asked whether exemption from
customs duty applied in cases where tenders were invited for the work to be done.
(30) Seconding that request for information, Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) thought that some
document should be produced for the Conference, outlining the working scheme for construction
and the procedure to be followed.
(31) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) was struck by the relative modesty of the figure for painters and
sculptors; also he thought the explanation of the second figure on page 9, namely 148,400,000
francs, too vague. He suggested that 20,000, 000 francs should be transferred to painters and
sculptors either from the sum of 148,400,000 francs or from the margin of $126, 000 mentioned
by the Acting Director -General.
(32) To meet the point made by Mr. Cowell, it was agreed that the Secretariat, in consultation
with the architects, should present such a document for approval to the Headquarters Committee
at a meeting to be held on 1 or 4 May. There would then be time to circulate the document to
Member States before the Extraordinary Session of the General Conference.
(33) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) was sure that the estimates had been prepared with
the greatest care, but they were bound to be tentative. He asked the architects if they could give
the Committee any idea of the area of uncertainty.
(34) Mr. ZEHRFUSS replied that a margin of 10% for unforeseen expenditure had been allowed on
each item, so that, unless there were some unexpected and spectacular rise in the cost of labour
and materials, the estimates could be counted as a maximum.

 VI-9.2                                   Headquarters           Committee
 (35) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) asked if the architects could supply estimates for the cost of
 the Executive Board building as now planned, so that the Committee and the Conference could dis-
  cuss the retention or suppression of the Board building with the relevant estimates.
 (36) Mr. BREUER had not brought the figures with him, but pointed out that the cost could be as-
  certained by deducting the cost of the Secretariat and Conference buildings from that of those
 buildings plus the Executive Board building in the latest plan. He would produce the figures for the
 afternoon meeting.
  (37) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) suggested that the cost of the additional building for the Executive
  Board should be annexed to the Committee’s report.
     Agreed,
  ITEM 3 - ESTIMATES OF THE COST OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL (9 HQ/2)
  (38) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL pointed out that an immediate decision had to be taken
  on the sum of $430,000 for the telephone system, as the latter would have to be installed at the
  same time as the building was being constructed.
  (39) In reply to a question from Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom), Mr. MONTAGNIER stated that
  the telephone system would be the same as that at present used in Unesco House. The inventory
  value of the latter was $400, 000.
  (40) Mr. BREUER explained that the architects had had great difficulty in estimating the cost of
  furnishings, etc., as they were dependent upon many different factors and were liable to vary by
  50%. They had been obliged to take the average of furnishing costs for other buildings which they
  had planned, and believed that they could furnish Unesco’s building for the sum of $400, 000, ex-
  cluding mobile furnishing for the offices of the Secretariat and delegates.
  (41) After thanking the architects for their assistance in the discussions, the CHAIRMAN adjourned
  the meeting until the afternoon.
     The meeting rose at 1. 15 p.m.
                                          SECOND MEETING
                                      Thursday, 2 April 1953, at 3 p. m.
                                           Chairman: Mr. MALIK (India)
  ITEM 3 - ESTIMATES OF THE COST OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL (9 HQ/2) (continued)
  (1) The CHAIRMAN recalled that the Committee had not had time, at its morning meeting, to con-
  sider the question of financing purchases of equipment and material, and he asked the Acting Dir-
  ector-Genera1 to present the Secretariat’s views.
  (2) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL said that the Secretariat had contemplated once again
  seeking the assistance of the French Government. Since part of the material would have to be re-
  placed after a certain number of years owing to normal wear and tear, it would not be possible to
  consider such a long-term loan as that already granted by France to cover the cost of building. A
  loan over a period of fifteen years could, for example, be envisaged. On the other hand, the Act-
  ing Director-General emphasized that about half of the material included in the architects’ estimate,
                                                        - 128 -

                                         Headquarters           Committee                            VI-9.2
i. e. the telephone and kitchen equipment, would have to be ordered fairly quickly. A solution
must therefore be found without delay for that part of the expenditure outlined in the estimate.
(3) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) asked how the United Nations had settled that question.
(4) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL believed that the cost of that equipment had been charged
to the building budget.
(5) Mr. MONTAGNIER added that part of the furnishings had been supplied by gifts from Member
States: thus, the Scandinavian countries had provided the wood for the committee rooms; France
had offered paintings. So far as Unesco was concerned, Mr. Montagnier explained that three pos-
sibilities had been considered: (1) the purchase of equipment and material could be charged to the
normal budget, although that would necessitate an increase of approximately 10% in the contributions
of Member States for the year in question, 1955 for example; (2) a loan could be obtained from a
bank or group of banks; in that case Unesco would have to pay interest; (3) the most advantageous
method would be that of an interest-free loan granted by a government; in that case the reimburse-
ment of a million-dollar loan over fifteen years would represent an additional annual expenditure
for Unesco of approximately $66,000. The possibility of using the Working Capital Fund had been
ruled out. The Comptroller did not believe it possible to spare more than $100,000 to $150,000,
repayable within a very short period, from the Working Capital Fund. The cost of telephone equip-
ment alone far exceeded the resources of the Working Capital Fund.
(6) Mr. BOUCHARD (France) felt that the Committee was faced by a very important and extremely
delicate problem, especially as Mr. Breuer had emphasized the very approximate nature of the
estimates submitted by the architects. For the moment he could make no statement on behalf of
the French Government. Speaking as an individual, he felt they had to distinguish between two
categories of expenditure: (1) essential equipment (telephone, kitchens); (2) material which it
was more or less possible to do without, and part of which might be donated by Member States,
following the example set during the construction of the United Nations Headquarters. Mr. Bou-
chard emphasized that the question of financing the cost of such equipment had not thus far been
raised, and that, in resolution 29.3, the General Conference had merely requested an estimate.
(7) ,Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) thought that, in view of the heavy burden which the French Govern-
ment had already agreed to assume, it would be advisable to approach other Member States with a
view to obtaining a second interest-free loan.
(8) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL pointed to the difficulty of negotiating with a few Member
States only. Moreover, an appeal should be made for contributions in kind towards the furnishing
of the new Unesco Headquarters. The Acting Director-General added that the total amount of the
French Government’s loan of $6,000,000 would not be required immediately. The Extraordinary
Session of the General Conference could authorize the Secretariat to draw on that loan provision-
ally for initial expenditure on equipment, leaving a final solution of this problem to the Montevideo
Conference. The essential point was to make immediate provision for an additional expenditure
of about $1, 000, 000 for equipment and material, over and above the $6,000,000 already provided
for building. The first orders for equipment would have to be placed as soon as construction
began, but the Secretariat would then require only about $400,000. The last payments would not
have to be made before 1956 and, in that case, the necessary decisions could be taken by the 1954
Session of the General Conference.
(9) Mr. BOUCHARD (France) felt it was important that all factors of the problem, together with
possible solutions, should be presented to the Extraordinary Session of the Conference. The actual
total cost of equipment and material would probably not be known before the Montevideo General
Conference.
(10) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) agreed with Mr. Bouchard. Mr. Carneiro’s suggestion had
the merit of envisaging a fair distribution of the financial burden, but it had to be remembered
that it would be rather difficult to persuade certain administrations and parliaments to include in
their national budgets provision for a relatively large and interest-free loan. It might be possible
to consider adding to the Working Capital Fund a special building fund, established on a basis pro-
portionate to the contributions of Member States.
(11) The CHAIRMAN suggested that the Committee instruct the Acting Director-General to open
                                                      - 129 -

       discussions with the French authorities and to report on the result at the meeting of the Committee
       to be held before the Extraordinary Session of the General Conference.
          Approved,
      (12) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) proposed that the Secretariat be requested to pre-
      sent to the Extraordinary Session of the General Conference a document on the possibility of ap-
      pealing to Member States to make donations for the furnishing and interior decoration of Unesco’s
      Headquarters.
         Approved.
      (13) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL pointed out that the Secretariat had already considered
      setting up a committee composed of the architects, the International Panel of Five Architects, and
      other experts, to advise Unesco on that subject.
      lTEM4- REPAYMENTS SCHEDULE OF THE LOANGUARANTEED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT (9 HQ/3)
      (14) Mr. MONTAGNIER gave details of the four repayment schedules outlined in document
      9 HQ/3. Two basic methods had been studied: according to the first, repayment would be made
      On an increasing annual scale; according to the second, the annual instalments would remain the
      same. Furthermore, in each case it had been anticipated that repayment could begin either in
      1954 or in 1956. Schedule No. 3, which provided both for repayment as from 1956 and for annual
      instalments of approximately $200,000, seemed to be the most favourable for Unesco. Repayment
     could then be deferred until the Organization no longer had ‘to make budgetary provision for the
      rent of its present premises; in addition, the adoption of a fixed annual instalment would be the
      easiest way from a budgetary point of view.
     (15) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) felt that the third proposed schedule should be adopted. He asked
     what additional financial burden that rate of repayment would throw upon the budget of Unesco.
     (16) Mr. MONTAGNIER replied that Unesco’s rent was approximately $66,000 per annum; re-
     payment of the French Government’s loan would, therefore, represent an addition of about $130.000
     per annum.
     (17) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) thought it would be better to make the first repayment against the
      1957-1958 Budget.
     (18) Mr. MONTAGNIER said that the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations did not, in principle,
     authorize deferred repayments. Schedule No. 1 conformed to the normal practice of that body.
     Unesco could, as an exceptional measure, obtain deferment until 1956, but it would probably be
     difficult to secure postponement of the first repayment until 1957.
     (19) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) pointed out that the 1955-1956 Budget would already have to include
     provision for the rental of the present premises until about the middle of 1956, as well as funds to
     meet the cost of removal. In order not to overburden that budget, it would be preferable not to
     begin repayment of the loan until 1957.
     (20) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL emphasized that the French authorities had shown great
     generosity in accepting the possibility of a two-year period; it appeared difficult to request an
     extension of that period, especially if discussions were to be opened with regard to the possibility
     of a further loan.
     (21) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) was anxious to pay tribute to the generosity of the French authorities,
     but felt it would be advisable to explain to them the special difficulties which Unesco had to face.
    (22) The Committee agreed to recommend the adoption of Schedule No. 3, on the understanding
    that the Acting Director-General would consult the French authorities as to the possibility of post-
    poning payment of the first annual instalment until 1957.

 ITEM 6 - DRAFT REPORT OF THE HEADQUARTERS COMMITTEE (9 HQ/5)
 (23) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) said he had merely drafted a very rough report which would have to
 be amended and completed, to include the decisions resulting from the latest discussions of the
 Committee.
 Paragraphs 1 and 2
 Approved without comment.
 Paragraph 3
 (24) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) felt that, in view of the agreement reached in the Committee, it
 would be advisable to delete the last part of this paragraph, from “Certain members deplored
 that . . . . . . ”
 (25) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) considered it should be mentioned in the report that additional
 buildings could be erected later to meet the future needs of permanent delegations and international
 organizations having relations with Unesco. It was important to emphasize that, in accepting the
 present project, the Committee had been far from overestimating requirements.
 (26) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL approved that suggestion.
 (27) On the proposal of Mr. DAVIES (Australia) it was agreed to delete the third, fourth and fifth
 sentences of paragraph 3, and to amend the last sentence in accordance with Mr. Carneiro’s
 suggestions.
 Paragraph 4
 (28) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) thought that the opinion expressed by the architects at the end of
 document 8 HQ/5 should be included in paragraph 4.
   Approved.
 Paragraph 5
 (29) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) agreed to a suggestion by Mr. Carneiro and Mr. Thomson that em-
 phasis should be laid in this paragraph on the example of perfect international co-operation shown
 by the architects. He further suggested that the minutes of the official meeting of the French
 authorities should be added to the documents to be submitted to the Extraordinary Session of the
 General Conference.
   Approved.
 Paragraph 6
 Approved without comment.
Paragraph 7
(30) On the proposal of Mr. DAVIES (Australia), it was agreed to delete the last sentence, since
it no longer corresponded to the present position, and to include particulars of the Committee’s
latest discussions.
Paragraph 8
(31) Mr. MONTAGNIER suggested that the Committee’s preference for the system of repayment
by fixed annual instalments should be mentioned in this paragraph.
(32) This suggestion was approved, on the understanding that the date of payment of the first
instalment would be dealt with in the supplementary report to be prepared by the Committee at its
next meeting.

  Paragraph 9
 Approved without comment.
  Paragraph 10
  (33) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) suggested pointing out, in an additional paragraph, that the Commit-
  tee had requested the Director-General to submit a document outlining the organization of the
  building work, the administrative problems involved, and the procedure to be followed for the
  purchase of equipment and material.
  (34) Mr. MONTAGNIER specified that these rules should also cover the submission of tenders
  for the different categories of work.
  (35) These suggestions were approved.
  Paragraph 11
  (36) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) suggested inserting in the preamble the text of
  paragraphs (a) and (b) of the preamble to resolution 29 adopted at the Seventh Session of the
  General Conference, as well as the paragraph relating to the privileges and immunities granted
  to Unesco, notably in the matter of taxation.
  (37) Miss THORNEYCROFT emphasized that that suggestion would require, in addition, repro-
  duction of the text of the annex referred to in the paragraph (a) mentioned by Mr. Thomson.
  (38) Mr. MONTAGNIER added that paragraph (b) mentioned a loan of 2, 025,000, 000 francs,
  whereas the sum given in the “Journal Officiel” was 2,100,000,000 francs.
  (39) Mr. BOUCHARD (France) considered it useless to quote verbatim texts which referred to a
  situation at least partly outdated. At the Extraordinary Session of the General Conference the
  French Government could make a definite offer in a letter which could be annexed to the final text
  of the resolution.
  (40) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) proposed the following wording: “Recalling the generous offer by
  the French Government of a site (see Annex) and of a loan of 2, 100,000,000 francs repayable over
  thirty years”.
     Approved.
  (41) Mr. MONTAGNIER stressed the importance of the fiscal immunities granted to Unesco and
  agreed with Mr. Thomson that it would be advisable to refer to that part of the preamble of reso-
  lution 29 which mentioned those immunities.
     Approved.
  X. 1 (1) Approved.
   x. 1 (2)
  (42) On the proposal of Mr. MONTAGNIER, the last line was amended as follows: ” . . . . . . and
   execute any necessary contracts relating thereto”.
     Approved.
  X. 1 (3) Approved.
   x. 1 (4)
   (43) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) seconded by Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil), proposed that the
   penultimate line should read: “. . . . . . such services as he may require”.
     Approved.

                                      Headquarters           Committee
 (44) Mr. MONTAGNIER felt that the fees of the architects and consultants, as given on page 9 of
 document 9 HQ/4, were too high. The official French tariffs varied between 3.5 and 5% of the
 total building estimate. It would be reasonable, in order to take the special nature of the work
 and the fact that the architects were of different nationalities into account, to adopt a percentage
 of 6%. The provision for the item could then be reduced to 96,000,000 francs.
 (45) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) approved that suggestion, which would make it possible to allocate
 a larger sum for contracts with painters and sculptors.
 (46) The Committee instructed the Acting Director-General to enter into negotiations on that
 point with the architects and at its next meeting to present a paragraph for inclusion in the draft
 resolution.
X. 2 and X. 3
(47) After a short discussion, it was agreed to delete these paragraphs, as the Committee would
 have to revert to the question of estimates for equipment and material at its next meeting.
 X.4
(48) It was agreed to delete the words “except in so far as its explicit recommendation is neces-
sary for expenditures from the Working Capital Fund”.
x. 5
    Approved without comment.
(49) The Committee agreed to hold its next meeting on 30 April.
    The meeting rose at 6. 0 p. m.

                                                  MEETING
                                     Wednesday, 20 May 1953, at 10 a. m.
                                          Chairman : Mr. M ALIK (India)

REPORT ON THE NEGOTIATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL WITH A VIEW TO OBTAINING
DEFERMENT OF REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN GUARANTEED BY THE FRENCHGOVERNMENT
(1) Mr. VALEUR (France) drew the Committee’s attention to the second paragraph of the letter
which he had sent to the Acting Director-General and explained that, though he was not in a pos-
ition to give a formal reply on the point, he had gathered from his conversations with the Finance
Ministry that the latter would be prepared to approach the Caisse des Dépots et Consignations and
to take of its own accord the necessary steps for obtaining deferment of repayment, despite the
supplementary charges it would then have to meet.
(2) The CHAIRMAN, summing up the remarks of the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL and Mr.
DAVIES (Australia) considered that the matter had been satisfactorily settled and thanked the
French Government on behalf of the whole Committee.
PROPOSALS OF THE ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL REGARDING THE FINANCING OF THE EQUIPMENT PLAN
(3) Mr. VALEUR (France) said that he could give a more formal reply on that point. The Finance
Ministry had stated that it regarded equipment expenses as construction costs. It was unlikely that
                                                     - 133 -

  VI-10.1                               Headquarters Committee
  Parliament would make any difficulties about granting an additional loan, requested for a project
  that had already been approved. However, it would be advisable to calculate the required amount
  as soon as possible.
  (4) Mr. MONTAGNIER did not think it possible to have an estimate until the architects had drawn
  up detailed plans of the Headquarters building, which would be six or eight months after the Extra-
  ordinary Session of the General Conference. A detailed estimate could be submitted to the General
  Conference in Montevideo.
  (5) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL thought that part of the estimates - for instance, the esti-
  mates for the telephone network - could be approved by the Extraordinary Session of the Conference.
  PROPOSALS OF THE ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL REGARDING THE MEASURES CONTEMPLATED FOR SETTING TO
  WORK ON THE BUILDING OF THE HEADQUARTERS (10 HQ/2)
  (6) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL explained that the establishment, within the Secretariat, of
  an Office to exercise very close supervision of the work was justified for two main reasons: first,
  it was essential that expenses should not exceed the stipulated amount; and secondly, there was no
  general contractor in France who could take charge of the whole job. This plan would also give as
  many Member States as possible an opportunity of assisting and taking part in the construction -
  which would not be feasible if a general contractor were employed. He drew the Committee’s
  attention to paragraphs (b) and (c) on page 2 of document 10 HQ/2, and explained, in connexion with
  paragraph (c), the need for obtaining all possible guarantees and, in particular, for avoiding sub-
  contractors. A similar but more ambitious scheme had been adopted by the United Nations which
  had set up, for the construction of its headquarters, a fairly large office, including the services of
  an architect. Moreover, that procedure, though not strictly speaking the custom, had been widely
  adopted over the past seven or eight years by international organizations or governments having
  buildings erected in France. In reply to a question from Mr. MALIK (India) the ACTING DIRECTOR-
  GENERAL stated that this scheme had met with the approval of Mr. Zehrfuss and Mr. Breuer, who
  thought it would be the best way of ensuring full and regular collaboration with the Secretariat.
   (7) Mr. VALEUR (France) considered the idea excellent but, in view of the technical problems of
   co-operation it entailed, wished to submit the scheme to experts in French ministries. Messrs.
  MALIK (India), THOMSON (United States of America) and DAVIES (Australia) agreed with Mr.
   Valeur.                                                     \
   (8) The CHAIRMAN, who also approved the general idea of an Office, asked for information about
   the composition of the Office and the way it would be set up.
   (9) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL emphasized that the Office would be essentially a prov-
   isional body, consisting of technicians on short-term appointments. In the early stages, while the
   detailed plans were being drawn up, it would consist only of a Project Director, a secretary and
   perhaps an assistant; various technicians would subsequently have to be appointed to supervise
   specific operations, but their total period of employment would not exceed the equivalent of a two-
   year contract for two or three persons. The Secretariat could submit detailed estimates to the
   Committee a few days before the Extraordinary Session of the Conference.
   (10) The Acting Director-General sated that he had arranged for the estimates submitted by the
   architects at the last meeting to be checked and that the figure thus obtained was 2% lower than the
   one given in document 2 XC/3. Member States would doubtless do likewise and it was to be hoped
   that very accurate figures would be available for replying to questions raised at the Conference, and
   that the total estimate could be reduced still further.
   (11) The CHAIRMAN enquired what the responsibilities of the Headquarters Committee would be,
   once the Office had taken over the technical control of the work.
   (12) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL replied that the Headquarters Committee would serve in
   an advisory capacity, as defined in the resolution given on pages 2 and 3 of document 2 XC/3.
   (13) Mr. MALIK (India) suggested that governments should be invited to recommend technicians
   with some experience in public works.

                                       Headquarters           Committee                               VI-10.1
(14) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) thought it might be possible to make use of techni-
cians previously employed by the United Nations.
 (15) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) also suggested that governments might be requested to release
technicians on the staff ‘of their ministries or public works services.
 (16) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) thought that a clause providing for the establishment of the proposed
Office should be inserted in the resolution submitted to the Conference for approval.
 (17) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL pointed out that paragraph 1 (4) of the resolution quoted
in document 2 XC/3 gave him the necessary authority, but it was perhaps advisable to give fuller
 details. In reply to a question from Mr. CHEN Yuan (China) he explained that the contracts would
 be drawn up through the Headquarters Office in conjunction with the Contract Committee in the
Secretariat, on which the Project Director would probably serve.
(18) He proposed that the Headquarters Committee should hold its next meeting on 29 June, two days
before the opening of the Extraordinary Session. The Secretariat would have to receive comments
from governments on such points as the estimates and the Headquarters Office at least ten days in
advance, if they were to be taken into account in drawing up the documents for submission to the
 Conference.
 (19) Document 10 HQ/2 was approved provisionally.
CONSIDERATION OF THE APPEAL TO MEMBER STATES REGARDING GIFTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ORNAMENTING
THE PERMANENT HEADQUARTERS (10 HQ/3)
 (20) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL reminded members that the matter had been under consi-
 deration for some time and that the example of the United Nations could be followed. It would un-
 doubtedly be advisable to set up a committee to ensure that gifts were in harmony with the archi-
 tecture of the building. To reduce costs, the committee could transact much of its work by cor-
 respondence and it could also consist of members residing in or near Paris.
 (21) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) wished to emphasize that one of the most important
 functions of the committee would be to provide directives for the decoration of the permanent
 Headquarters. The committee should therefore be convened at an early date and work in close co-
 operation with the architects.
 (22) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) thought it might even be advisable to indicate in the document that the
 architects’ approval was required.
  (23) Several members expressed misgivings about the results of the appeal, and after a general
  discussion, during which it was suggested that certain categories of gifts, such as furniture and
  supplies, should be ruled out, Mr. MONTAGNIER explained that the Secretariat had been guided
 by the example of the League of Nations and the United Nations. It seemed unnecessary to refuse
  outright certain categories of gifts, which might reduce the expenditure on equipment. As for the
  membership of the committee, the Secretariat had thought it might include, in addition to the archi-
  tects, a representative of the Headquarters Committee, a representative of the Panel of Five, and
  three persons selected on the recommendation of the International Association of Artists which had
  just been set up under Unesco’s auspices (e. g. two artists and one art critic).
  (24) Mr. PATERNOTTE de la VAILLEE (Belgium) thought it necessary to include a person of re-
  cognized standing, such as the Director of Arts and Letters of the French Ministry of Education or
  the Director of Museums in France.
  (25) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) was prepared to approve the document in principle, but he
  suggested placing paragraph 4 after paragraph 5 (a); it would then of course be necessary to re-
  number the paragraphs.
  (26) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) was in favour of deleting paragraph 4.
  (27) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL thought authorization would be necessary, as the estab-
  lishment of the Committee would involve some expenditure.

    VI-11.1                                 Headquarters Committee
    (28) Document 10 HQ/3 was approved in principle, subject to more detailed consideration.
     REPORT ON THE PRESENTING OF THE PRELIMINARY PLAN TO FRENCH AUTHORITIES (Meeting of 21 April 1953)
     (10 HQ/4)
    (29) Mr. MONTAGNIER reported on behalf of Mr. Valeur that, after the meeting of 21 April, all
    the competent French services had received and were making a study of the preliminary plan. The
    French Government would forward the comments of those services before the opening of the Confer-
    ence.
    (30) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) pointed out, in connexion with document 2 XC/Z, that the
    British experts were referring to Mr. Le Corbusier’s opinion of the Conference building, which
    seemed to them faulty in some respects. He drew special attention to the slope of the roof, the fact
    that the delegates’ offices had no natural light or windows, and the unsatisfactory acoustics of the
    room designed for plenary sessions, and wondered whether it would be possible to raise the height
     of the building. The distance separating it from the office building was a still more serious diffi-
    culty. In conclusion, Mr. Cowell thought it would probably be necessary to give further study to
    that part of the plan.
     (31) After some discussion, Mr. MONTAGNIER said that in his opinion there was no question of
    modifying the general structure, but that further study was required - a view with which all the
    architects concurred.
    (32) It was decided to adjourn discussion of that point, pending the receipt of further information.
     MISCELLEANEOUS        QUESTIONS
    (33) The minutes of the last session were approved, subject to any corrections that had already
    been or might be received.
        The meeting rose at 1.30 p. m.
                                      ELEVENTH SESSION
                                                FIRST MEETING
                                            Monday, 29 June 1953, at 10 a. m.
                                        Chairman: Mr. PARRA-PEREZ (Venezuela)
    (1) Opening the session, the CHAIRMAN extended a welcome to Miss d’Olne, replacing Mr. Pater-
     notte de la Vaillee and to Mr. Pompei, replacing Mr. de Clementi.
      ITEM 1 - ADOPTION OF THE PROVISIONAL AGENDA (11 HQ/l)
     (2) At the CHAIRMAN’s suggestion, it was agreed to start with the items of particular interest to
    the architects, namely, items 6, 5. 2 and 4.
     (3) Subject to the above change of order, the agenda was adopted.
     ITEM 2 - APPROVAL OF THE SUMMARY RECORD OF THE TENTH SESSION (10 HQ/SR)
    (4) The Summary Record of the Tenth Session was approved.

ITEM 6 - CONSIDERATION OF THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT AND ESTIMATED COST OF CONSTRUCTION (2 XC/2 and
2 XC/2 Addendum 1)
(5) Introducing document 2 XC/2 Addendum 1, the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL stated that,
since the Committee’s last meeting, the estimates of building costs presented by the group of three
architects had been carefully reviewed and checked; further, Member States had been asked to
draw up their own estimates. Such precautions did not in any way imply lack of confidence in the
architects, but had been taken simply in order to be able to speak with real authority before the
General Conference. Detailed estimates for each unit of the plan were given in document 2 XC/2
Addendum 1.
(6) Mr. MONTAGNIER added that when the Secretariat had received the architects’ estimates, it
had forwarded them to Mr. Roger Lemoine, an auditor of building costs, to be checked. Mr. Le-
moine had submitted a report of considerable length, containing his own estimates for the various
categories of buildings. As compared with those of the three architects, they were as follows:
                                          Mr. Lemoine’s estimates                      Architects’ estimates
Secretariat                            1,381,322,460 French francs                 1,519,374, 000 French francs
Executive Board building                   37, 790, 040 ”            ”                 47,304,000       ”   ”

                                                                                   Secretariat building
                                                                                   (13, 974, 000 frs. )
                              Total    1, 995, 085, 100 ”                          2,120,100,000 francs
(7) The difference between the architects’ estimates and those of Mr. Lemoine was thus only some
125,000, 000 French francs, and Mr. Lemoine expressed the opinion, in the conclusion to his re-
port, that the architects’ estimates were as accurate as they could possibly be during the present
preliminary stage of the work. In any case, Mr. Lemoine considered that the 15% reduction of the
first estimates presented by the architects was a maximum.
(8) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) enquired whether experts of the French Government
had been able to make an additional check of the figures.
(9) Mr. BOUCHARD (France) said that, although no officialy reply had yet been received, the esti-
mates finally reached by the French authorities would probably be very similar to those of the ar-
chitects and the auditor.
(10) While expressing his satisfaction at such reliable estimates, Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom)
asked if they were based on the type of Conference Hall shown in the model before the meeting, or
on a different type of building providing for more light and air. He recalled that serious objections
to the original plan of the Conference building had been raised.
(11) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL confirmed that the estimates were based on the plans as
presented by the architects and approved by the Committee. Whether any changes should be made
when implementing the plans would be for the three architects to decide; it might be that they would
submit alternative plans for the Conference building, in which case new estimates would have to be
prepared.
(12) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil), seconded by Mr. MALIK (India), moved that the Committee approve
the architects’ estimates in document 2 XC/2 Addendum 1 for submission to the General Conference.
(13) The proposal was unanimously adopted.
 ITEM 5.2 - BUILDING SCHEDULE FOR THE HEADQUARTERS (11 HQ/5 and 11 HQ/7)
(14) Speaking on item 5 in general, Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) emphasized the importance of ensuring
continued collaboration between the three architects and the International Panel of Five Architects
                                                         - 137 -

  VI-1 1.1                              Headquarters            Committee
  until the construction of the Headquarters building had actually been completed. He suggested that
  the Chairman of the Panel or a member designated by him should remain in permanent contact with
  the three architects. Realizing that his suggestion would call for a certain amount of extra expend-
  iture, he proposed that the Chairman of the Headquarters Committee, the Chairman of the Panel of
  Five Architects and Messrs. Breuer, Nervi and Zehrfuss should meet and discuss ways of finding
  the necessary sum of money.
  (15) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL drew Mr. Carneiro’s attention to the draft resolution on
  pages 2 and 3 of document 2 XC/3; the second part of paragraph 2 on page 3 read: “The Head-
  quarters Committee is authorised to convene and consult with the International Panel of Five
  Architects if and when it deems necessary”. Further, on page 1 of document 11 HQ/3. relating to
  gifts and works of art, it was proposed that a Committee of Art Advisers be established, and that
  one of its members should be a representative of the Panel of Five Architects. It thus seemed that
  provision had been made for continued collaboration with the Panel. As for the expenditure involved,
  the Secretariat had already envisaged a certain budgetary appropriation to implement the draft re-
  solution in document 2 XC/3. He personally thought that any request for advice or assistance from
  the Panel of Five Architects in the execution of the plans should come from the three architects
  themselves, and he asked the Committee to give the matter very careful consideration before agree-
  ing to Mr. Carneiro’s suggestion and altering the existing provisions.
  (16) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) observed that he had been aware of the passages quoted by the Acting
  Director-General, but had felt that they were too vague. His proposal was to make the draft reso-
  lution in document 2 XC/3 more explicit by inserting, on page 3, the following new paragraph (5):
    “(5) TO designate the Chairman of the Panel of Five Architects, or his deputy, to follow, in close
  collaboration with the three architects, the actual execution of the project adopted by the General
  Conference”.
  (17) The CHAIRMAN suggested that Mr. Carneiro’s proposal be considered under item 5.1 - Head-
  quarters Office.
     Agreed.
  (18) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL having introduced documents 11 HQ/5 and 11 HQ/7,
  Mr. BOUCHARD (France) pointed out that the third paragraph of the letter reproduced in document
   11 HQ/7 was perhaps not sufficiently clear. The three months required to demolish existing
  buildings and level the ground should be counted from the date of the evacuation of the buildings,
  i.e. from 30 September 1953; the site could therefore be handed over to Unesco on 1 January 1954.
  (19) Referring to document 11 HQ/5, Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) asked if “Beginning of main
  structure” meant the Secretariat building only.
  (20)    The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL replied that “main structure” implied all the buildings.
  (21) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) asked whether six months would not be required
  for detailed designing; it seemed to him optimistic to schedule the digging of the foundations for
  1 January 1954.
  (22) Mr. BREUER replied that two methods were possible: (1) a general contract covering the
  whole project could be passed at the start; or (2) everything could be contracted when the project
  was completed; in the meantime, direct sub-contracts could be passed as the work proceeded. If
  the first method were adopted, ten to twelve months would probably be required for detailed design-
  ing, and the buildings would not be completed when Unesco needed them. With the second method,
  which he would strongly advise, detailed designing would be a little ahead of execution in each case.
  (23) It was agreed to transmit documents 11 HQ/5 and 11 HQ/ 7 to the Extraordinary Session of the
  General Conference.
  ITEM 4. GIFTS AND WORKS OF ART (11 HQ/3)
  (24) Emphasizing the need for a general plan which would ensure aesthetic unity, Mr. CARNEIRO
  (Brazil) proposed that the architects be assigned the additional task of laying down criteria to be
                                                          - 138 -

followed by Member States in selecting paintings, frescoes or statues for donation to the Head-
quarters Building. The architects would also be responsible for refusing unsuitable works. Mr.
Carneiro suggested that Member States might even be generous enough to offer original master-
pieces, such as French tapestries or Greek statues, thus embellishing the building and transforming
it into a valuable museum.
(25) Mr. MONTAGNIER recalled that at the Committee’s last meeting, when Mr. Carneiro had not
been present, the following procedure had been approved: (1) the Committee of Art Advisers and
the architects would meet to discuss a general aesthetic plan; (2) their recommendations would be
circulated to Member States; (3) the Committee of Art Advisers and the architects would then meet
again to consider offers made by Member States. However, such a procedure could not be envisaged
until the detailed plans were ready.
(26) In reply to a question from Mr. THOMSON (United States of America), the ACTING DIRECTOR-
GENERAL said that no artists had yet been consulted regarding a general plan integrating the three
main forms of art, but the matter had been discussed with Mr. Gropius over the past year.
(27) Referring to Mr. Carneiro’s remark concerning the probable generosity of Member States,
Mr. BOUCHARD (France) was not in a position to commit his Government, which had, in any case,
already given proof of its goodwill in the case of the Headquarters building; however, personally he
hoped that it would be able to contribute towards the general aesthetic plan. He pointed out that the
programme of Unesco’s Department of Cultural Activities included a resolution relating to a syn-
thesis of the plastic arts. Lastly, he mentioned that the “Commission des Sites” had recently
approved the preliminary plan, expressing the hope that, in executing it, there would be collabor-
ation between the architects and the competent French services; he hoped that that collaboration
would bear on the exterior decoration,
(28) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL pointed out that it was the architects who were designing
the building and that, in the last analysis, it should be left to them to decide whether or not a work
of art was suitable.
(29) Mr. GROPIUS drew attention to the fact that certain political difficulties were involved; how-
ever, he thought that the architects should at least be given some sort of veto right. The Commit-
tee of Art Advisers might well not see eye to eye on all occasions; art was an extremely subjective
matter, and some members of the Committee might be in favour of modern art, while others only
cared for Old Masters. Personally, he thought the two could be combined, but it was essential to
have some central authority to decide upon what was, or was not, acceptable.
(30) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) considered it unfair to saddle the architects with the political
responsibility of refusing gifts from Member States; such responsibility should be shouldered by
the General Conference, the Executive Board, the Director-General or the Headquarters Committee.
(31) Mr. MALIK (India) proposed that it be left to the Director-General, acting on the advice of the
Headquarters Committee, the architects and the Committee of Art Advisers, to decide whether or
not a work of art was acceptable.
(32) Mr. BREUER suggested that two representatives of the working architects might sit on the
Committee of Art Advisers. With regard to the wording of document 11 HQ/3, he pointed out that
architecture also was an art, and that when the intention was to refer to paintings, sculpture or
frescoes, those words should be substituted for “art”.
(33) Mr. ROGERS drew attention to the importance of respecting the freedom of artists, who had a
sense of responsibility; the problem of ensuring aesthetic unity was not a political one, and its
solution should be left as far as possible to the Committee of Art Advisers.
(34) With regard to Mr. Gropius’ suggestion concerning the architects’ right of veto, Mr. DAVIES
(Australia) thought it a matter to be decided when the Committee of Art Advisers had been estab-
lished and its Rules of Procedure were being worked out. He wondered whether it would be ap-
propriate for the representative of the Headquarters Committee, itself an advisory body, to have a
vote in the Committee of Art Advisers.
(35) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL suggested that the representative of the Headquarters
                                                      - 139 -

  Committee might be an “ex officio” member of the Committee of Art Advisers. He thought that
  Mr. Breuer’s proposal to add a second representative of the working architects was an excellent
   one.
   (36) Referring to the draft resolution on pages 2 and 3 of document 11 HQ/3, Mr. COWELL (United
  Kingdom) moved the deletion of the last line of paragraph 5 on page 3, and the insertion of the
  following new paragraph 6:
      “Delegates to the Director-General the responsibility of deciding, in the light of the advice
  provided for in this resolution, whether a work of art offered to Unesco should be accepted or
  rejected”.
      Adopted.
      The meeting rose at 12. 55 p. m.
                                            SECOND MEETING
                                        Monday, 29 June 1953, at 3.30 p. m.
                                     Chairman: Mr. PARRA -P EREZ (Venezuela)
   ITEM 4.  GIFTS AND WORKS OF ART (11 HQ/3) (continued)
   (1) The CHAIRMAN opened the meeting and reminded members that they had to complete item 4 of
  the agenda.
   (2) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) read the English text of the draft resolution to be inserted in section 5
   on page 2 of document 11 HQ/3 and apologized that there had been no time to make a French
  translation.
   (3) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) after congratulating the Rapporteur upon the speed with which
  the draft resolution had been drafted, pointed out, in connexion with section 4 (a), that a general
  plan would have to be drawn up for Member States. Mr. DAVIES (Australia) suggested meeting his
  point by inserting, in paragraph 5 on page 3 of the document in question, the words “in accordance
  with the general plan established” between “whether” and “they wish”.
   (4) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) strongly emphasized his view that the draft resolution should make
   some mention of the Headquarters Committee, as it was a body set up by the General Conference
   and consisted of representatives of Member States. He thought that the Panel of Five should form
   a kind of sub-committee of the Headquarters Committee, which should itself send to the Director-
   General the report of the five architects. It would be risky to set up too many independent bodies.
   Mr. Carneiro therefore suggested substituting “Headquarters Committee” for “Director-General”
   in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the draft resolution.
   (5) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) thought that the difficulty could be settled by substituting the
  words “in the light of the advice available” for “on the advice available” in paragraph 6 of the draft
   resolution.
   (6) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL held that recourse to the advice of the Panel of Five was
   optional; responsibility for the choice of the furniture and decoration rested not with the five inter-
   national architects, as might be gathered from paragraph 5 (page 3 of document 11 HQ/3), but with
   the three architects appointed, as specified in the second paragraph of section 3 (page 2 of document
   11 HQ/3). The Acting Director-General accordingly suggested reversing the order of paragraphs
   5 and 6.

                                        Headquarters            Committee                              VI-11.2
(7) Mr. BOUCHARD (France), supported by Mr. POMPEI (Italy), proposed another amendment to
paragraph 4 (a) of the draft resolution submitted by Mr. Davies, as follows:
    “(a) preparer, pour le Directeur general en consultation avec le Comité du Siege, . , . ” (the rest
unchanged. )
(8) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL, supported by Mr. DAVIES (Australia), agreed to the de-
letion, in paragraph 4 (a), of the phrase “in consultation with architects”; but he was afraid that
the amendment proposed by Mr. Bouchard might create difficulties. He felt that a liaison should
be provided between the Committee of Art Advisers, on the one hand, and the Director-General and
the Headquarters Committee, on the other hand, to enable them to remain in permanent contact.
(9) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) contended that the Headquarters Committee was giving up too many of
the responsibilities entrusted to it by the General Conference and that its policy was suicidal. In
his opinion, the buildings as a whole were inseparable from their decoration; the Headquarters
Committee should therefore advise the Director-General both as to the buildings and their decor-
ation. Mr. Carneiro was formally opposed to making the Panel of Five independent of the Head-
quarters Committee and said that he might bring the matter up again before the General Conference.
(10) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL stated that Mr. SABA (Legal Adviser) was suggesting that
paragraphs 4 to 6 should be inserted in the resolution and become paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, to be
followed by the former paragraphs 2 and 3. In this way, the functions of the Headquarters Commit-
tee would be brought out more clearly.
(11) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) held that the Headquarters Committee should act in advisory
and not in an executive capacity; the Director-General should therefore be allowed full discretion
to seek the advice of the Headquarters Committee or not, as he chose.
(12) The CHAIRMAN having asked the views of Mr. Saba (Legal Adviser) on that point, the latter
gave it as his opinion that, according to Mr. Bouchard’s interpretation, the Headquarters Commit-
tee acted as an advisory body, not only for the Director-General but also for the services respon-
sible for preparing the plans, even before those plans had been submitted to the Director-General.
(13) The CHAIRMAN, summing up, stated that it had been unanimously decided to delete, in para-
graph 4 (a) of the draft resolution presented by the Rapporteur, the words “in consultation with
architects”, and he enquired whether Mr. Bouchard really insisted on replacing it by “in consulta-
tion with the Headquarters Committee”. Mr. BOUCHARD (France) said he was prepared to with-
draw his proposal if Mr. Carneiro and Mr. Pompei agreed.
(14) Reverting to paragraph 6, Mr. DAVIES (Australia) proposed the following new wording:
   . . . in the light of such advice as he may decide to obtain under the present resolution . . . “.
Mr. BOUCHARD (France) personally preferred the following wording: ".. . en s’entourant des avis
qu’il lui est possible de recevoir aux termes de la présente resolution . . . ”
 (15) At the CHAIRMAN’s request, Mr. SABA (Legal Adviser) explained that the expression “a la
lumière de” could be taken in an imperative sense; the new wording proposed by Mr. Davies left
the Director-General full latitude to seek advice or not, whereas Mr. Bouchard's new wording went
back to the first interpretation. Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) said that he would prefer “in the
 light of”. Mr. DAVIES (Australia) then suggested “in the light of such advice as he may seek”.
Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) proposed accepting the Director-General’s suggestion
that paragraph 2 should become paragraph 6, and that the last wording proposed by Mr. Davies
 should be approved.
(16) The CHAIRMAN put to the vote Mr. Thomson’s proposal, supported by Mr. Cowell and Mr.
 Bouchard. Adopted by a majority, with one vote against and no abstentions.
 ITEM 3 - CONSIDERATION OF THE DRAFT LEASE OF THE QUARTIER FONTENOY SITE (11 HQ/2)
 (17) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL, supported by the CHAIRMAN and all members of the
 Committee, expressed his gratitude to the representatives of the French Government and the mem-
 bers of the Secretariat, especially Mr. Saba and Mr. Montagnier, who had helped to prepare the
 draft.

    VI-11.2                                Headquarters           Committee
    (18) Mr. SABA (Legal Adviser) stated that only the French text was authentic, as the English text
    was merely a rather hurried translation made by an English lawyer. He explained that the draft
    lease solved a number of difficulties raised by the problem of building on a site belonging to a third
    party. Article 2 authorized the renewal of the lease at the end of the first 99-year period for fur-
    ther successive periods of 99 years, although, in principle, French law did not authorize leases of
     more than 99 years. Article 4 also settled a complicated problem: if Unesco decided to transfer
    its Headquarters to another place in France or outside France and ceased to use the premises it-
    self, it could. with the consent of the French Government, transfer the benefit of the lease to
    another international organization; but not to a private individual. In the absence of any such tran-
    sfer to an international organization, the lease would terminate automatically after a period of four
    years from the day on which the Organization notified the French Government of its intention to
    vacate the premises. In that case, the French Government would have the option of purchasing the
    buildings at a price to be determined by the market value of the premises at the time of purchase -
    the transfer to be made either by agreement or by arbitration. However, if the option was not
    exercised within a year, Unesco would have an option to purchase the site at its market value, such
    transfer also to be made either by agreement or by arbitration. That was a most important con-
    cession granted by the French Government, since, according to French law, buildings belonged to
    the owner of the site on the expiry of long-term leases. However, Article 8 provided that the lease
    should not become final until it was approved by the French Parliament. That decision might not be
     obtained by 1 January 1954. A guarantee from the French Government would then be required, to-
     gether with authorization to begin building as from the date in question; the French Government
    would further undertake to refund the expenses incurred in building, should Parliament fail to give
    its approval - which was highly improbable.
    (19) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) had two points to make. With regard to Article 4,
    he enquired what would happen in the case of ‘Porte majeure”, such as an outbreak of war. Secondly,
    he asked whether the Secretariat could give figures for the expenses referred to in Article 6.
     (20) In reply to the first question, Mr. SABA (Legal Adviser) did not think that any case of “force
    majeure” could arise in connexion with Article 4. The Organization might then be obliged to transfer
    its Headquarters provisionally; but the provisions of that Article were operative only when the
    Organization had notified the French Government of its intention to vacate the premises permanently.
    After all, a case of “force majeure” could arise only if, upon the expiry of a normal period of ninety-
     nine years, Unesco were not in a position to correspond with the French Government, but the time
     limit for notification could then be automatically extended.
     (21) With regard to City, Police and Highway Duties, Mr. MONTAGNIER explained that they were
     only for services rendered. In the current year, $2, 750 had been paid under that heading for the
    premises Unesco was occupying at the moment. For the Place de Fontenoy, an amount of $3, 500
    had been ear-marked. In reply to Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom), Mr. Montagnier explained that
     the Organization was already paying these taxes.
     (22) The CHAIRMAN stated that document 11 HQ/2 would be referred to the General Conference
    with the Committee’s recommendation.
     ITEM 5.1 - HEADQUARTERS OFFICE (11 HQ/4 (Addendum to document 10 HQ/2))
     (23) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL said that, in accordance with the Committee’s request at
     its last session, the Secretariat had endeavoured to draw up more detailed budget estimates for the
     Headquarters Office. He regretted that it had been necessary to increase the previous estimate of
     roughly $175,000 to $197,629 - a change due to increased Indirect Personnel Costs, in accordance
    with the Secretariat’s new policy in that respect. The Acting Director-General strongly recom-
     mended the Committee to accept those budget estimates.
     (24) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) enquired whether the Secretariat had made sure that there
     was adequate and clearly defined liaison between the Director-General and the architects. The
    ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL explained that the Director-General could not evade that responsi-
     bility because he needed the Headquarters Office. If the work were contracted out, there would be
     a danger of overlooking possible mistakes until it was too late.
     (25) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) suggested that the Headquarters Committee should
                                                           - 142 -

                                        Headquarters           Committee                              VI-11.2
  delegate to the Burea, consisting of the Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Rapporteur, responsibility
  for liaison with the Panel of Five, as defined in Article 2.
  (26) Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil) enquired whether the meetings of the Panel of Five would be suspended
 when the plans were completed, or whether they would continue at least until work had begun on the
 building. The Headquarters Committee would not know when it was necessary to advise the three
 architects, in the first place because it was not qualified to do so and, secondly, because it would
  not be keeping a close watch on the work during the following six months. He suggested that the
 Headquarters Committee might decide to convene the Panel of Five before the buildings had been
 completed and even before the work began, and to hear the views of the five architects in four, five
 or six months’ time, when the detailed designs were completed. Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom)
 pointed out that such a procedure was possible under resolution 29.2 (c).
 (27) The CHAIRMAN stated that document 11 HQ/4 would be referred to the Conference with the
 Committee’s recommendation.
 ITEMS 7 AND 8 - METHODS OF COVERING COST OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIAL (11 HQ/6) - TABLE COMPARING
 ANNUAL EXPENDITURES ON HEADQUARTERS BUILDING (11 HQ/8)
 (28) The ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL stated that the French Government expected to be able
 to start paying the instalments of the additional loan of $1. 000,000 before 1957. When the Organi-
 zation stopped paying the rent of the Kléber building, the money thus economized could be used to
 cover the cost of the move to the Place de Fontenoy. Expenditure connected with the new Head-
 quarters building would therefore not appear in the budget before 1957.
 (29) Mr. MONTAGNIER explained that Unesco would also apply to the “Caisse des Dépôts et
 Consignations” for the additional sum to cover equipment and material; however, in this second
 case, the French Government had requested that the amount be reimbursed within a shorter time -
 probably within twenty years.
 (30) Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom) wished to pay tribute to the sympathetic and helpful attitude
of the French Government. He asked for an assurance that, in the case of the second maximum
amount envisaged, it was a question, not of a sum of 2,500 million francs, but of the equivalent in
French francs of the sum of 7 million dollars.
(31) Mr. BOUCHARD (France) explained that the first sum of 2,100 million French francs corres-
ponded to 6 million dollars; the new ceiling which might be proposed to Parliament was 2,500
million francs, corresponding to the additional sum needed for equipment. As the latter estimate
was only approximate, the Ministry of Finance had settled on a round figure which should cover
such an increase.
(32) After associating himself with Mr. CowellIs tribute to the French Government, Mr. DAVIES
(Australia) proposed that the following sentence should be inserted on page 3 of document 2 XC/3,
between paragraphs X. 1 (3) and X. 1 (4): “To authorize the Director-General to purchase, at a cost
not exceeding $1,080,000, the necessary equipment and material”. The ACTING DIRECTOR-
GENERAL agreed to the above proposal, which was seconded by Mr. COWELL (United Kingdom).
(33) Requesting an explanation of two minor points, Mr. THOMSON (United States of America)
enquired whether the words “considerably shorter”, in the fifth line of the last paragraph of
document 11 HQ/6, meant a period of twenty years. Secondly, he wondered what was meant by
“which, in principle, would be thirty years”.
(34) Mr. BOUCHARD (France) explained that the principle of a thirty-year loan was still generally
accepted, but, in the (case of the second loan, the “considerably shorter” period had not yet been
officially defined; he believed, however, that the Ministry of Finance envisaged a rather shorter
period than the twenty years mentioned by Mr. Montagnier.
(35) Mr. MONTAGNIER pointed out that a period of twenty years was in fact “considerably shorter”
than a period of thirty years, and if reimbursement had to be effected, for example, in fifteen years,
each repayment would amount to $72,000, as opposed to $54,000 in the case of reimbursement over
a period of twenty years.

 VI-11.2                                Headquarters           Committee
 (36) Mr. THOMSON (United States of America) having asked if expenditure for the Headquarters
 Office, amounting to approximately 200,000 dollars, was included in the total of 6 million dollars,
 the ACTING DIRECTOR-GENERAL referred the Committee to document 2 XC/3, Annex IV, page 2,
 where there was a “credit balance available” of $143, 095. 68. He added that it had taken the Sec-
 retariat a long time to prepare the estimates and it had had to work at high speed, so that they
 were bound to be only approximate.
 (37) Mr. VALEUR (France) regretted that he had been unable to be present at the beginning of the
 meeting and was very touched by the cordial welcome he had received. He was glad to be able to
 announce that the first instalment, of the loan granted by the French Government, at Unesco’s re-
 quest, i. e. a sum of 200,000, 000 francs, was henceforth at the Organization’s disposal, as a
 result of the steps taken by the “Caisse des Depôts et Consignations”.
 (38) Mr. DAVIES (Australia) asked whether the Secretariat had accepted the French Government’s
 offer to reimburse expenditure incurred in connexion with the Porte Maillot site. The ACTING
 DIRECTOR-GENERAL replied that the Secretariat had not yet received any funds, but that negoti-
 ations were in progress.
 (39) At the CHAIRMAN’s proposal, it was agreed to transmit both documents under discussion to
 the General Conference.
 REPORT OF THE RAPPORTEUR
 (40) The CHAIRMAN announced that Mr. Davies had already prepared his report; he assumed that
 the Committee would have no objection to leaving that to the Rapporteur, without a further meeting.
 (41) In view of the many proposals which he had made and which had not been seconded, Mr. CAR-
 NEIRO (Brazil) requested that the minutes of the current session be communicated to the delegations
 of Member States. Mr. MONTAGNIER pointed out that there was very little time in which to re-
 produce the two summary records before the Extraordinary Session of the General Conference, and
 further, that the minutes of the other sessions of the Headquarters Committee had not been communi-
 cated to Member States, because the report had not yet been distributed. Mr. CARNEIRO (Brazil)
 did not intend to press his proposal, but was a little surprised to learn that Member States were not
 kept more fully informed about meetings of a body composed of representatives of Member States.
 Mr. MONTAGNIER replied that the Headquarters Committee was an organ of the General Confer-
 ence and that, in such cases, the Secretariat did not circulate the minutes unless instructed to do
 so by the Conference. The Committee could, however, if it so desired, recommend a different
 procedure to the Conference.
 (42)    The CHAIRMAN thought that the matter could be settled at the next session.
    The meeting rose at 8 p. m.
