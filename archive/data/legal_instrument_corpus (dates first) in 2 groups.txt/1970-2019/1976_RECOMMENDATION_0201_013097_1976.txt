The General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, meeting in Nairobi from 26 October to 30 November 1976, at its nineteenth session, 

Recalling that under the terms of Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, `everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits', 

Recalling that the Constitution of UNESCO states, in its Preamble, that the wide diffusion of culture, and the education of humanity for justice and liberty and peace are indispensable to the dignity of man, 

Recalling the provisions of the Declaration of the Principles of International Cultural Co-operation adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 4 November 1966 at its fourteenth session, and in particular Article I which states that `each culture has a dignity and value which must be respected and preserved', and Article IV which stipulates that one of the aims of international cultural co-operation is `to enable everyone to have access to knowledge, to enjoy the arts and literature of all peoples, to share in advances made in science in all parts of the world and in the resulting benefits, and to contribute to the enrichment of cultural life', and also the provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to the effect that the participating States, `desiring to contribute to the strengthening of peace and understanding among peoples and to the spiritual enrichment of the human personality without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion', will set themselves the objective, amongst others, of promoting access by all to their respective cultural achievements, 

Considering that cultural development not only complements and regulates general development but is also a true instrument of progress, 

Considering:  
(a) that culture is an integral part of social life and that a policy for culture must therefore be seen in the broad context of general State policy, and that culture is, in its very essence, a social phenomenon resulting from individuals joining and co-operating in creative activities, 
(b) that culture is today becoming an important element in human life and one of the principal factors in the progress of mankind, and that an essential premise for such progress is to ensure the constant growth of society's spiritual potential, based on the full, harmonious development of all its members and the free play of their creative faculties, 
(c) that culture is not merely an accumulation of works and knowledge which an elite produces, collects and conserves in order to place it within reach of all; or that a people rich in its past and its heritage offers to others as a model which their own history has failed to provide for them; that culture is not limited to access to works of art and the humanities, but is at one and the same time the acquisition of knowledge, the demand for a way of life and the need to communicate, 

Considering that participation by the greatest possible number of people and associations in a wide variety of cultural activities of their own free choice is essential to the development of the basic human values and dignity of the individual, and that access by the people at large to cultural values can be assured only if social and economic conditions are created that will enable them not only to enjoy the benefits of culture, but also to take an active part in overall cultural life and in the process of cultural development, 

Considering that access to culture and participation in cultural life are two complementary aspects of the same thing, as is evident from the way in which one affects the other-access may promote participation in cultural life and participation may broaden access to culture by endowing it with its true meaning-and that without participation, mere access to culture necessarily falls short of the objectives of cultural development, 

Noting that cultural action often involves only a minute proportion of the population and that, moreover, existing organizations and the means used do not always meet the needs of those who are in a particularly vulnerable position because of their inadequate education, low standard of living, poor housing conditions and economic and social dependence in general, 

Noting that there is often a wide discrepancy between the reality and the proclaimed ideals, declared intentions, programmes or expected results, 

Considering that while it is essential and urgent to define objectives, contents and methods for a policy of participation by the people at large in cultural life, the solutions envisaged cannot be identical for all countries, in view of the current differences between the socio-economic and political situations in States, 

Reaffirming the principles of respect for the sovereignty of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, equality of rights and the right of peoples to self-determination, 

Aware of the responsibility which devolves upon Member States to implement cultural policies for the purpose of advancing the objectives set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, the Constitution of UNESCO, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Declaration of the Principles of International Cultural Co-operation, 

Bearing in mind that elimination of the economic and social inequality which prevents broad sections of the population from gaining access to knowledge which is the foundation of science and technology, and from becoming aware of their own cultural needs, implies broader participation on their part; that to these obstacles must be added a resistance to change, and barriers of all kinds, whether they are of political or commercial origin or take the form of a reaction by closed communities, 

Considering that the problem of access and participation can be solved by collective approaches extending to many sectors and aspects of life; that such approaches should be diversified according to the special characteristics of each community, the whole forming a true design for living calling for basic policy options, 

Considering that access to culture and participation in cultural life are essential components of an overall social policy dealing with the condition of the working masses, the organization of labour, leisure time, family life, education and training, town-planning and the environment, 

Aware of the important role that can be played in cultural and social life by: young people, whose mission is to contribute to the evolution and progress of society; parents, particularly because of the decisive influence which they exercise on the cultural education of children and the development of their creativity; elderly people who are available to discharge a new social and cultural function; workers, because of the active contribution they make to social changes; artists, as creators and bearers of cultural values; cultural development personnel whose task is to secure the effective participation in cultural life of all sections of the population and to ascertain and express their aspirations, relying for this purpose on the collaboration of the spontaneous leaders of the community, 

Considering that access and participation, which should provide everyone with the opportunity not only to receive benefits but also to express himself in all the circumstances of social life, imply the greatest liberty and tolerance in the fields of cultural training and the creation and dissemination of culture, 

Considering that participation in cultural life presupposes an affirmation of the personality, its dignity and value, and also the implementation of the fun-damental rights and freedoms of man attested by the Charter of the United Nations and international legal instruments concerning human rights, and that the cultural development of the individual is hindered by such phenomena as the policy of aggression, colonialism, neo-colonialism, fascism and racism in all its forms and manifestations, as well as by other causes, 

Considering that participation in cultural life takes the form of an assertion of identity, authenticity and dignity; that the integrity of identity is threatened by numerous causes of erosion stemming, in particular, from the prevalence of inappropriate models or of techniques which have not been fully mastered, 

Considering that the assertion of cultural identity should not result in the formation of isolated groups but should, on the contrary, go hand in hand with a mutual desire for wide and frequent contacts, and that such contacts are a fundamental requirement without which the objectives of the present recommendation would be unattainable, 

Bearing in mind the fundamental part played by general education, cultural education and artistic training, and the use of working time and free time, with a view to full cultural development, in a context of life-long education, 

Considering that the mass media can serve as instruments of cultural enrichment, both by opening up unprecedented possibilities of cultural development, in contributing to the liberation of the latent cultural potential of individuals, to the preservation and popularization of traditional forms of culture, and to the creation and dissemination of new forms, and by turning themselves into media for group communication and promoting direct participation by the people, 

Considering that the ultimate objective of access and participation is to raise the spiritual and cultural level of society as a whole on the basis of humanistic values and to endow culture with a humanistic and democratic content, and that this in turn implies taking measures against the harmful effect of `commercial mass culture', which threatens national cultures and the cultural development of mankind, leads to debasement of the personality and exerts a particularly harmful influence on the young generation, 

Having before it, as item 28 of the agenda of the session, proposals concerning participation by the people at large in cultural life and their contribution to it, 

Having decided at its eighteenth session that this question should be made the subject of an international regulation, to take the form of a recommendation to Member States, 

Adopts, this twenty-sixth day of November 1976, the present Recommendation. 


The General Conference recommends Member States to implement the following provisions, taking whatever legislative or other steps may be required-in conformity with the constitutional practice of each State and the nature of the question under consideration to apply the principles and norms formulated in this Recommendation within their respective territories.

III. Technical, administrative, economic and financial measures  

5. It is recommended to Member States, if they have not already done so, that they make the necessary technical, administrative and financial resources available to upgrade policies for cultural action from the insignificant position to which they may still be relegated until they reach an operationally effective level enabling them to achieve the goals of life-long education and cultural development and to ensure to the maximum that the people at large have access to culture and participate freely in cultural life. For this purpose Member States should take the following measures: 

 A.  Ways and means of cultural action Decentralization of facilities, activities and decisions

Concerted action  

7. Member States or the appropriate authorities should encourage concerted action and co-operation both as regards the activities themselves and decision-making:

(a) by paying special attention to creative cultural and artistic non-institutional and non-professional activities and by providing all possible support to amateur activities in all their diversity; 

(b) by establishing advisory structures, at the local, regional and national levels, bringing together representatives of the professional and social groups concerned who will participate in determining the objectives and ways and means of cultural action. 

Trade unions and other workers' organizations  

8. Member States or the appropriate authorities should take all such measures as will be of assistance to socio-cultural organizations for the people at large, trade unions and other workers' organizations for wage-earners or the self-employed (farmers, craftsmen, etc.) in freely carrying out their cultural policies or projects so as to enable them to enjoy the whole wealth of cultural values and to take an active part in the cultural life of society. 

Animation 

9. Member States or the appropriate authorities should:

(a) contribute to the training of cultural development personnel, in particular of `animateurs', who should act as information, communication and expression intermediaries, by putting people in contact with each other and serving as a connecting link between the public, the work of art, and the artist, and between the public and cultural institutions; 

(b) provide such personnel with means of action enabling them, on the one hand, to give support to the spontaneous `animateurs' of local communities and, on the other hand, to stimulate initiative and participation, using the necessary training methods; 

(c) encourage the use of instruments and equipment for communication and expression which have education value and offer a potential for creation, by making them available to cultural centers and institutions such as public libraries, museums, etc.

(h) give technical, administrative and financial assistance to groups of amateur artists and support co-operation between non-professional and professional artists. 

Cultural industries 

11. Member States or the appropriate authorities should make sure that the criterion of profit-making does not exert a decisive influence on cultural ac-tivities, and, in drawing up cultural policies, provide for machinery for negotiating with private cultural industries, as well as for supplementary or alternative initiatives. 

Dissemination  

12. Member States or the appropriate authorities should: 

(a), adopt a policy of granting subsidies and awarding prizes for cultural goods and services, and bring about conditions which will ensure that they are disseminated and become accessible to the broadest possible social cate-gories, particularly in cultural fields neglected by commercial enterprises;

Education  

15. Member States or the appropriate authorities should: 

(a) link cultural plans systematically with educational plans within the context of life-long education embracing the family, the school, community life, vocational training, continuing education and cultural activity;

Environment  

17. Member States or the appropriate authorities should:
