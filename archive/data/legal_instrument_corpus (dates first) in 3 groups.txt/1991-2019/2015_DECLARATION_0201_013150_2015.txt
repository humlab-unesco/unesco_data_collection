Article 9 – Safety and the management of risk are necessary conditions of quality provision 

9.1	Physical education, physical activity and sport must take place in a safe environment that protects the dignity, rights and health of all participants. Practices and events that undermine safety, or involve inappropriate risk, are incompatible with the integrity and potential benefits of physical education, physical activity and sport; such practices and events require a determined and immediate response.

9.2	Safety and the management of risk require that all stakeholders seek to rid physical education, physical activity and sport of practices that limit or harm participants, spectators and educators, especially the more vulnerable groups in society such as children, youth, the elderly, women, persons with disabilities, migrants and indigenous people.

Article 10 – Protection and promotion of the integrity and ethical values of physical education, physical activity and sport must be a constant concern for all 

10.1	All forms of physical education, physical activity and sport must be protected from abuse. Phenomena such as violence, doping, political exploitation, corruption and manipulation of sports competitions endanger the credibility and integrity of physical education, physical activity and sport and undermine their educational, developmental, and health promoting functions.

The universally adopted anti-doping rules must be implemented at all levels of performance by the competent international and national authorities. 

10.3	The manipulation of sport competitions undermines the core values of sport. Combined with betting, the manipulation of sport competitions offers large scale business opportunities for transnational organized crime. Effective measures must be taken to foster national and international co-operation against the manipulation of sport competitions, as well as a coordinated global response in line with the relevant international instruments.

10.4	All organizations and institutions dealing with physical education, physical activity and sport must implement principles of good governance.

10.5	Any employer in the field of physical education, physical activity and sport or related areas must pay due consideration to the psychological and physical health of their employees, including professional athletes. International labour conventions and basic human rights must be respected, in particular to avoid child labour and human trafficking.

10.9 Prevention programmes which include values-based education and information components are crucial. These programmes should foster positive attitudes towards anti-doping in sport and negative attitudes towards manipulations, corruption, misconduct and exploitation and should be provided to participants, including referees, public authorities, law enforcement, sports organizations, betting operators, owners of sports-related rights, the media, non-governmental organizations, administrators, educators, families, the medical profession and other stakeholders.  

10.10 Public authorities and sports organizations should encourage the media to promote e and protect the integrity of physical education, physical activity and sport. The media are invited to fulfill their role as critical and independent observers of events, organizations and stakeholders, informing the public of the benefits, risks and educational values of physical education, physical activity and sport.

Article 11 – Physical education, physical activity and sport can play an important role in the realization of development, peace and post-conflict and post-disaster objectives 

11.1	Sport for development and peace initiatives should aim at eradicating poverty, as well as strengthening democracy, human rights, security, a culture of peace and non-violence, dialogue and conflict resolution, tolerance and non-discrimination, social inclusion, gender equality, the rule of law, sustainability, environmental awareness, health, education and the role of civil society.

11.3	Sport for development and peace initiatives should be inclusive, and culture-, gender-, age- and disability-sensitive, and include strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. They should encourage local ownership of projects and embody the same principles of sustainability and integrity as other physical education, physical activity and sport initiatives. 

Article 12 – International co-operation is a prerequisite for enhancing the scope and impact of physical education, physical activity and sport 

12.1	Through international co-operation and partnerships, all stakeholders should place physical education, physical activity and sport at the service of development, peace, solidarity and friendship among individuals, communities and nations.

12.2	International cooperation and partnerships should be used for effective advocacy, at the international, regional and national levels, about the important contributions of physical education, physical activity and sport to social and economic development, while supporting and sharing related research and evidence.

12.3	International co-operation and partnerships amongst public authorities, sports organizations and other non-governmental organizations are crucial to reduce existing disparities between and within States in the provision of physical education, physical activity and sport. This can be achieved through the exchange of good practice, education programmes, capacity development, advocacy, as well as indicators and other monitoring and evaluation tools based on the universal principles set forth in the present Charter.
